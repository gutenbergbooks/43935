<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The present volume was prompted by the
thought that no adequate account of the late
William E. Burton had been given to the public.
During his life no man was better known,
and his death called forth a universal expression
of admiration for his genius and regret for
his loss. In the many obituary notices by the
press some brief details of his career were
given; but the narrative was necessarily confined
to the narrow limits of a newspaper
article. An actor so eminent&mdash;one of the
greatest in his line the stage has known,&mdash;whose
name is identified with certain delineations
of character that died with him; whose
renown stamped his theatre with a celebrity
distinct and remarkable; a Shakespearian
scholar, whose devotion to the poet, attested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
by the incomparable library he amassed, was
only equalled by his interpretation of the
master's spirit, surely is entitled to a more
pains-taking and a more extended record. An
endeavor is here made to supply such need;
and in the view taken of Burton as Actor,
Author, and Manager, the relation is from birth
to death.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this volume, the author
owns his indebtedness to Ireland's "Records
of the New York Stage," Wood's "Personal
Recollections," Wemyss's "Theatrical Biography,"
Hutton's "Plays and Players,"
Phelps's "Players of a Century," Clapp's
"Record of the Boston Stage," and Stone's
"Theatrical Reminiscences." The writer also
gratefully acknowledges the assistance given
him by members of Mr. Burton's family, and
their loan to him of old play-bills, engravings,
letters, etc. Mr. Matteson, of New York, may
also be mentioned in acknowledgment of
friendly aid.</p>

<p>The illustrations accompanying the memoir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
will be viewed with interest. The frontispiece
is from a daguerreotype, and has been chosen
as a faithful likeness of the comedian. The
<i>Bob Acres</i> is from a painting by T. Sully, Jr.;
the <i>Dr. Ollapod</i> from a portrait by Henry
Inman; the <i>Captain Cuttle</i> and <i>Aminadab
Sleek</i> from daguerreotypes; the <i>Timothy
Toodles</i> from a photograph. All the above were
family possessions. The picture of the Chambers
Street Theatre is from a water-color
drawing in the collection of Thomas J. McKee,
Esq.</p>

<p>Many shortcomings will doubtless be found
in this book, and readers of it who are old play-goers
may think of many things the author has
missed. But we are told by Ruskin that there
is "no purpose so great but that slight actions
may help it," and by Wordsworth that</p>

<h2>WILLIAM E. BURTON.</h2>

<p class="center">1804-1834.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">William Evans Burton</span>, the son of William
George Burton, an author of some repute, was
born in London, September 24, 1804, and died
in New York, February 10, 1860. His father was
a printer, with a bent of mind toward theology,
and gave expression to his views in a work entitled
"Biblical Researches," published in the
close of the last century. The son was classically
educated in St. Paul's School in London,
an institution where, before his day, Elliston
and the elder Mathews were instructed; and
the father's design was to prepare him for the
ministry. The parent's death, however, summoned
him from his studies, and, at the age
of eighteen, he assumed the direction of the
printing-office, which he managed for the maintenance
of his mother. It may be observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
that one of the specialties of the elder Burton's
business was the printing of classical works,
and the son's knowledge had often been of service
in the matter of proof-reading. From the
printing-office he was led to the experiment of
editing a monthly magazine, thus early revealing
an inclination toward the profession of letters
which never wholly deserted him; fostered
by sundry efforts of authorship in his native
land, and appearing subsequently, in this country,
in his conduct of "The Gentleman's
Magazine" and "Literary Souvenir," and in
the compilation known as "Burton's Cyclopædia
of Wit and Humor."</p>

<p>The youthful experiment was not a substantial
success, and did not long continue; but his
editorship brought him into connection with
certain members of the dramatic profession,
and he was persuaded (we wonder if persuasion
were really needed!) to make a trial of his
stage ability by playing with a company of
amateurs. His success in this venture foreshadowed
his destiny, and we find him in 1825
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
performing with a provincial company on the
Norwich, Sussex, and Kent circuits.</p>

<p>We cannot help the indulgence, at this moment,
of a playful fancy regarding Burton's
early efforts. Did he, in the exemplification
of tragedy, which he then aspired to, reveal by
a single facial example the dawning of a future
<i>Toodle?</i> Could imagination discover in the
dagger of <i>Macbeth</i> the hook, and in the Thane
himself the features, of <i>Ed'ard Cuttle, Mariner
of England?</i> Did the thoughtful countenance
of <i>Hamlet</i> suggest in any possible way the
lugubriousness of an incipient <i>Sleek?</i> Did he
make his Majesty George IV. laugh at Windsor,
where, as tradition has it, he played before
the king at this stage of his career? We know
not; but the mask of Melpomene had been
thrown aside when, after another round of the
provinces, with varying success, but gaining
celebrity through an unusually wide range of
parts, he made his first appearance in London
in 1831, as <i>Wormwood</i>, in "The Lottery
Ticket," a character that became famous in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
his hands. This engagement was at the Pavilion
Theatre, and was a highly successful one.
The great Liston, just twice Burton's age, was
then at the Haymarket, and we can imagine
with what emulous admiration the young
comedian regarded the veteran actor. He
little dreamed that many of Liston's renowned
characters would descend to him by right of
ability and comic power! In the following
year (1832) Liston retired from the Haymarket,
"through a pique," as they say, and Burton
succeeded him; but the audiences retained too
vivid a recollection of Liston's performances,
and the engagement was only moderately successful.
Recovering suddenly from his disaffection,
Liston returned to the Haymarket,
and Burton in his turn retired, to once more
make the rounds of the provinces. But he
bore with him one remembrance in connection
with the Haymarket that consoled him for
many a disappointment; and that was the
thought of having played <i>Marall</i> to Edmund
Kean's <i>Sir Giles Overreach</i>. The story runs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
that Mrs. Glover,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
a leading actress of the company,
objected for some reason to the <i>Marall</i>,
and declared that she or Burton should be
omitted in the cast. Kean, despite irregularities,
still retained a remnant of his old sway,
and he insisted on being supported by Burton.
The result was that Mrs. Glover was compelled
to yield, and in due course <i>Marall</i> appeared
before a full house, containing many celebrities
of the day. It was at this time, too, that a
production of his pen&mdash;the play of "Ellen
Wareham,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
&mdash;enjoyed the unusual distinction
of being performed at five London theatres on
the same evening. A year and a half went by
in efforts to enhance his reputation, and it may
be said that his career was not free from the
vicissitudes that frequently attend dramatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
itineracy. But through it all he gained ground
and advanced steadily in his profession. He
played almost every thing; his industry was
indefatigable, his will indomitable. The lamp
of experience never waned; and that knowledge
gained from contact with the world and
human nature, was a preparation for events
and emergencies in another scene and another
land. For now his thoughts were turned
toward the United States, and in 1834 he determined
to cross the ocean, and to take the
chance of fortune and of fame.</p>


<p class="center spaced space-above">1834-1848</p>

<p>Burton landed on our shores unheralded,
to begin the twenty-five years of the artistic
career which holds so conspicuous a place in
the annals of dramatic achievement. He was
not "brought over," and he came at his own
expense. He came, indeed, with the prestige
of having written "Ellen Wareham," and of
having made a comic character<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
famous by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
fifty consecutive representations; but he was
simply announced as coming "from the Pavilion
Theatre, London," and he made his first
appearance in America at the Arch Street
Theatre, Philadelphia, under the management
of Maywood &amp; Co., on September 3, 1824,
playing <i>Dr. Ollapod</i>, in Colman's "Poor Gentleman,"
and <i>Wormwood</i>, in "The Lottery Ticket."
<i>Ollapod</i> always remained one of Burton's most
effective parts. The portrait, on another page,
of the comedian in that character is from an
engraving by J. Sartain of a picture painted
from life by Henry Inman, in 1840.</p>

<p>There lies before us a bill (elsewhere reproduced)
of the above theatre, dated Wednesday,
September 10, 1834, being the fourth night of
Burton's first engagement in this country.
The plays on the occasion were Sheridan's
comedy of "The Rivals" and the farce of
"The Lottery Ticket,"&mdash;which last seems to
have met with great favor, as the bill states it
to be a repetition, owing to "numerous enquiries
having been made at the box-office";
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
thus beginning the train of similar "numerous
enquiries" with which, in the years to come,
his own box-office became familiar. Burton
was the <i>Bob Acres</i> of the comedy and <i>Wormwood</i>
in the farce. Then at the age of thirty,
we can believe that the comedian's unfolding
genius gave full promise of the delightful
humor which clothed his <i>Acres</i> at a later day;
and that in the <i>Wormwood</i> of the farce he
afforded glimpses of that wealth of comic
power which thereafter, and for so long, he
lavished for the amusement of the public.
Miss Pelham was the <i>Lydia Languish</i> and Miss
Elphinstone the <i>Julia</i>, English actresses of no
special distinction; but it is interesting to note
that Miss Elphinstone became the second wife
of Sheridan Knowles, the author of a celebrated
and far more popular <i>Julia</i> than the
lady of "The Rivals," and who appeared on
the Philadelphia stage of that year.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Mr. Burton As Bob Acres.</span></div>

<p>Something akin to his reception by the
audiences at the Haymarket in London, was
for a time Burton's experience in Philadelphia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
As the recollection of Liston by the London
audience dwarfed the efforts of the youthful
aspirant, so the memory of Joseph Jefferson,
senior, (who played in the city as late as
1830,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>)
diluted the interest felt in the new
actor by the Philadelphia benches.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
But the
native force and humorous capability of the
comedian were destined to conquer indifference;
and, although the creative genius which
informed his subsequent delineations was yet
to be made clearly manifest, he soon had a
secure footing; and a belief was strengthening
in the public mind that an actor of rare endowments
and promise had come from the land of
Munden, Elliston, and Liston, and one who
might, it was not too much to say, worthily
perpetuate the traditions of Jefferson.</p>

<p>On the fifth night of his engagement (September
12, 1834) he played <i>Timothy Quaint</i>, in
"The Soldier's Daughter," and <i>Tristam Sappy</i>,
in the afterpiece of "Deaf as a Post," and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
on through a round of characters in comedy
and farce&mdash;<i>Daffodil Twod</i>, among the latter, in
"The Ladies' Man"&mdash;written by himself&mdash;was
a great favorite. And it may here be said, in
passing, that the farce, which previous to Burton's
advent had sunk into lethargy, revived
under his touch and became a vital point of
attraction. He made a great hit as <i>Guy Goodluck</i>,
in "John Jones," in which part he sang a
comic song&mdash;"A Chapter of Accidents"&mdash;and
the fact leads us to remark that very few of
those who saw the comedian in his ripe prime
were aware of the musical talent he exhibited
in earlier years, and that he made a specialty
of introducing humorous ballads in his pieces,
and sang them with marked effect. A collection
of such songs, entitled "Burton's Comic
Songster," was published in Philadelphia in
1850; and we were surprised, on looking it
over, at the quantity of mirthful verse he had
written and sung. The well-known ditty of
"The Cork Leg," it may be mentioned, was
written expressly for him.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-4.jpg"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><img src="./images/1-4thumb.jpg" alt="" title="Arch Street Poster"></img></span></a><br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<p>The engagement of Burton with Maywood
&amp; Co. lasted two years, and was renewed for
two more, during which period the comedian's
powers greatly developed, and displayed remarkable
versatility and dramatic resource.
He widely extended his repertory, and was
seen at the Arch and Chestnut Street theatres
in a variety of comedy rôles and in innumerable
farces. Among the many noted parts performed
by him at various times we may name:
<i>Ollapod</i>, in "The Poor Gentleman"; <i>Doctor
Pangloss</i>, in "The Heir at Law"; <i>Farmer Ashfield</i>,
in "Speed the Plough"; <i>Goldfinch</i>, in
"The Road to Ruin"; <i>Billy Lackaday</i>, in
"Sweethearts and Wives"; <i>Tony Lumpkin</i>, in
"She Stoops to Conquer"; <i>Maw-worm</i>, in
"The Hypocrite"; <i>Sir Peter Teazle</i> and <i>Sir
Oliver Surface</i>, in "The School for Scandal";
<i>Mr. Dove</i> and <i>Mr. Coddle</i>, in "Married Life";
<i>Dogberry</i> and <i>Verges</i>, in "Much Ado About
Nothing"; <i>Launcelot Gobbo</i>, in "The Merchant

last-named character he played on one

occasion with the conjunction of the elder
Wallack as <i>Capt. Absolute</i>, Tyrone Power as
<i>Sir Lucius O'Trigger</i>, and Mr. Abbot (an actor
celebrated in his day) as <i>Falkland</i>; truly a
striking distribution. A few of the farces out
of the many were "The Lottery Ticket,"
"Sketches in India," "The Mummy" (so
famous in Chambers Street), "No Song No
Supper," "John Jones," "Deaf as a Post,"
"The Ladies' Man," and a piece called
"Cupid," which had won renown in England
through the acting of the famous John Reeve.</p>

<p>Burton's growing popularity was substantially
shown in the attendance at his regular
benefits. They were always bumpers, and occasions
of warm demonstrations of regard. He
was always ready, too, with his sympathy and
support where the claims of a professional
brother were in question. William B. Wood,
in his "Personal Recollections of the Stage,"
to which work we are indebted for much useful
information, refers to an occurrence of the
kind as follows: "I must apologize for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
mention here of a circumstance purely personal,
which proved one of the most gratifying
events of my life. During the month of December,
1835, while acting in Chestnut Street,
Burton called me aside between the acts, and
with an expression of great pleasure, informed
me that a meeting for the purpose of giving
me a grand benefit had just adjourned, after
completing the necessary arrangements. This
was the first hint I ever had of this intention.
The object was at once carried into effect, and
on the 11th of January, 1836, I was honored
by the presence of one of the most brilliant
audiences ever assembled.... The following
entertainment was offered: 'Three and
Deuce,' two acts of 'Venice Preserved,' 'John
of Paris,' 'Antony's Orations,' and a new song,
and 'How to die for Love.' I was favored in
these pieces with the valuable aid of Mr. Balls,
Mr. J. Wallack, Mr. Abbot, Mrs. and Miss
Watson, Mr. Wemyss, and Mr. Burton."</p>

<p>In the years while the comedian was advancing
in his profession, and acquiring that knowl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
edge of the stage which distinguished his
subsequent management, his pen was not idle.
He wrote several farces, and contributed stories
and sketches to the periodicals of the day.
These articles were widely read, and a collection
of them was published by Peterson at a
later date, with the title, "Waggeries and
Vagaries"&mdash;a volume that has afforded entertainment
to many readers of light literature.
The literary taste referred to at the beginning
of this narrative now sought indulgence, and
in 1837 he started "The Gentleman's Magazine,"
a monthly publication of original miscellany.
Articles of his own appeared in it
from time to time, among others a graceful
and appreciative sketch of his friend, James
Wallack. He continued the editorship until
July, 1839, when he associated Edgar A. Poe
with him in the control.</p>

<p>To those who have paid any attention to the
career of the gifted author of "The Raven,"
as depicted by various pens in recent years, it
need scarcely be said that, though a man of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
genius, he was not without frailties; and his
warmest defenders will not deny that his life
was marred by many irregularities of conduct.
He was appointed editor of the magazine at a
fixed salary, and the arrangement was such as
to give him leisure to contribute to other periodicals
and to produce many of his famous
tales. "Happier now," says one of his biographers,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
"than he had been for years past, for
his prospects seemed assured, his work regular,
interesting, and appreciated, his fame increasing,
he writes to one friend that he 'has quite
overcome the dangerous besetment,' and to
another that he is 'a model of temperance and
other virtues.'" For nearly a year he remained
with Burton; "but," continues the same biographer,
"so liable was he still to sudden relapses
that the actor was never with confidence
able to leave the city. Returning on one occasion
after the regular day of publication, he
found the number unfinished, and his editor
incapable of duty. He left remonstrances to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the morrow, prepared the 'copy' himself, and
issued the magazine, and then to his astonishment
received a letter from his assistant, the
tone of which may be inferred from Burton's
answer: 'I am sorry you have thought it necessary
to send me such a letter. Your troubles
have given a morbid tone to your feelings
which it is your duty to discourage. I myself
have been as severely handled by the world as
you can possibly have been, but my sufferings
have not tinged my mind with melancholy,
nor jaundiced my views of society. You must
rouse your energies, and if care assail you,
conquer it. I will gladly overlook the past. I
hope you will as easily fulfil your pledges for
the future. We shall agree very well, though
I cannot permit the magazine to be made a
vehicle for that sort of severity which you
think is so "successful with the mob." I am
truly much less anxious about making a monthly
"sensation" than I am upon the point of
fairness. You must, my dear sir, get rid of
your avowed ill-feelings toward your brother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
authors. You see I speak plainly; I cannot
do otherwise upon such a subject. You say
the people love havoc. I think they love justice....
But I wander from my design. I
accept your proposition to re-commence your
interrupted avocations upon the <i>Maga</i>. Let
us meet as if we had not exchanged letters.
Use more exercise, write when feelings prompt,
and be assured of my friendship. You will
soon regain a healthy activity of mind, and
laugh at your past vagaries,'" We think
nothing can be clearer than that Burton had
good cause for fault-finding, and that he was
more than considerate and just in his frank expression
of feeling.</p>

<p>We do not intend to pursue the ill-starred
connection further. A more glaring offence
on Poe's part severed the relationship, and not
long thereafter the magazine was sold out to
Graham and merged in his "Casket," the consolidation
ultimately to become "Graham's Magazine."</p>

<p>"The Literary Souvenir," an annual published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
by Carey &amp; Hart, was edited by Burton in
1838 and 1840, and its pages contained many of
his entertaining sketches. He also contributed
to the "Knickerbocker Magazine" a series of
theatrical papers styled "The Actor's Alloquy."
Occasional starring tours belong to the chronicle
of these years, and there lies before us a
bill of the American Theatre, Walnut Street,
dated October 14, 1839, announcing "First
night of the re-engagement of Mr. Burton,"
and also that "His Excellency Martin Van
Buren, President of the United States, will
honor the theatre with his presence." The
President must have been greatly amused, for
not only did he see the comedian as <i>Tom Tape</i>
and <i>Peeping Tom</i>, but he also saw him "dance
with Mrs. Hunt the Minuet de la Cour and
Gavotte de Vestris." Burton was fairly well
known now throughout the Union&mdash;except in
the town of Napoleon, on the Mississippi
River, where, if we may believe Mr. Davidge,
he found his Waterloo. The engagement had
not been profitable, and his only hope was by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
personally drumming for his benefit. So he
deposited a goodly number of tickets with the
bartender at the hotel where he was staying,
with a polite request that he would use his
best endeavor to get rid of them. The benefit
came off, and the attendance was very flattering.
After the play the comedian invited several
friends up to the bar, and there had the
satisfaction of learning that the man had managed
to dispose of all the tickets entrusted to
him. This was very gratifying; but no offer
of settlement being made, he ventured to suggest
that, as he was on the point of quitting
the town, he would like to have the pleasure
of receiving the insignificant amount of seventy-five
cents for each piece of pasteboard deposited.
Mr. Davidge says it takes a great
deal to astonish a barkeeper in Napoleon; but
this one was distanced. He surveyed Burton
for a quarter of a minute, and seeing not a
muscle move in the comedian's expressive
countenance, he said: "Look here, Mr. Billy
Burton, none of your infernal Northern tricks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
here; it won't do, no way! You told me to
get rid of them tickets, and as I had promised
I was bound to go straight through with it&mdash;<i>and
by thunder, I was obliged to stand drinks to
every man to take one!</i>" An audience may be
uncultured if not lukewarm; and the unimpressible
community of Napoleon reminds us
that the "Antigone" of Sophocles was once
produced under Burton's management, and,
on loud and repeated calls for the <i>author</i>, the
comedian presented himself before the foot-lights
and said: "Ladies and gentlemen, it
would give me the greatest pleasure to introduce
the author of the play; but, unfortunately,
he has been dead for more than twenty
centuries, and I shall have to throw myself
upon your indulgence."</p>

<p>Burton made his first appearance in New
York October 31, 1837, at the old National
Theatre in Leonard Street&mdash;then under the
management of the elder Wallack&mdash;for the
benefit of Samuel Woodworth, the poet, playing
<i>Guy Goodluck</i>, in "John Jones"; and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
first appearance as a star was made at the same
theatre February 4, 1839, when he played <i>Billy
Lackaday</i>, in "Sweethearts and Wives," and
<i>Guy Goodluck</i>. A complimentary benefit was
given to Mr. Wallack in the same year, when
Burton played <i>Sir Simon Slack</i>, in "Spring and
Autumn." The opera of "Amilie; or, The Love
Test" was produced on the same occasion. If
we mistake not, he was connected with the
management when the theatre was destroyed
by fire not long after. He also appeared at
Niblo's Garden as a star in this year, opening
June 21th, and was seen in a round of parts,
including <i>Gregory Thimblewell</i>, <i>Euclid Facile</i>,
<i>Ignatius Polyglott</i>, and <i>Tobias Munns</i>, in his
own farce of "Forty Winks." He first appeared
on the Park stage June 2, 1840, playing
<i>Sir Timothy Stilton</i>, in "Patrician and Parvenu,"
the occasion being a complimentary
benefit to Peter Richings; and in the same
month acted at Niblo's Garden. At his benefit
(July 6th) he played <i>Brown</i>, in "Kill and
Cure," and <i>Fluid</i> in "The Water Party." The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
participation of the Cushman sisters in this
entertainment greatly enhanced its interest
and attractiveness. In this year he fitted up
Cooke's circus-building in Chestnut Street,
Philadelphia, calling it the National Theatre.
He gathered a fine company and was very
prosperous. Charlotte and Susan Cushman
appeared there, and the sterling comedians
Henry and Thomas Placide were among the
force. The fairy piece, "The Naiad Queen,"
was there presented for the first time in the
United States, and brought wealth to the manager's
coffers. A large amount of his earnings
by this enterprise he invested in Nick Biddle's
United States Bank, and in the downfall of
that institution suffered severely.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-5.jpg"><br />

<div class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Mr. Burton as Dr. Ollapod.</span></div><br />

<p>In 1841, after a brief engagement at the
Providence theatre, he returned to New York,
and leased the rebuilt theatre corner of Leonard
and Church streets, where his first appearance
in New York had been made; brought on
his Philadelphia company, and there established
himself. This was April 13, 1841, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
his first essay as manager in New York. He
transported all the beautiful scenery of "The
Naiad Queen," and reproduced the piece with
gratifying success. But a dread fatality seemed
to attend this temple of the drama. As, while
under Wallack's management, it was destroyed
by fire, so the same doom befell it under
Burton. In the height of prosperity the building
was again consumed, and with it the elaborate
and splendid scenery of "The Naiad
Queen." Of this calamity, F. C. Wemyss, in
his "Theatrical Biography," remarks: "On
this occasion a magnificent and extensive
wardrobe, the property of Mr. Burton, was
consumed, together with his private wardrobe,
manuscripts, books, and other articles of considerable
value. He was not insured to the
amount of a dollar. The citizens of New York
expressed their sympathy with the manager;
and a complimentary benefit at the Park placed
a handsome sum at his disposal." Undaunted
by a disaster which would have utterly discouraged
most men, Burton again sought Philadelphia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and after starring for a brief season
leased the Chestnut Street Theatre for a fresh
essay. There for a while he continued with
good fortune, until better prospects invited
him to Arch Street, where at last he located
with a view to permanency. Meeting now
with rich success, he determined to extend his
sphere of operation, and added in turn to his
lesseeship the Front Street Theatre, Baltimore,
and the theatre in Washington; so that in
1845-6 he was guiding the destinies of three
dramatic houses, distinguished for well-chosen
companies and for the admirable manner in
which the plays were mounted and cast. But
again the fiat of destiny was written in words of
flame. The Washington theatre, for the first
time in many years, was handsomely rewarding
its manager, when one night, during the performance,
the scenery caught fire, and the
building was burnt to the ground. The Baltimore
theatre was continued; but the lion's
share of attention was given to Arch Street,
and there for several years Burton enjoyed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
flow of prosperity; his fame increasing in public
estimation; surprising and delighting all by
his wonderful acting, and by the knowledge,
taste, and liberality, with which he catered for
his patrons. But New York was in the manager's
thoughts and seemed to beckon him
Northward. Perhaps Burton's prophetic gaze
discerned in the great city a field that would
respond to careful tillage, and that the rapid
growth of the metropolis could not fail to give
momentum to enterprise. Whatever the motive
spring, the step was taken, and in 1848
the building known as Palmo's Opera-House
became Burton's Theatre.</p>

<p>In this brief survey of fourteen years, the absence
of detail in many instances will be pardoned,
we hope, on a reflection of what it may
suggest. We are aware of the interest attaching
to strength of companies, citations of casts,
and notes of special performance; and in all
theatrical histories such details should evoke
the most careful consideration. The Philadelphia
record, however, is not always full and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
clear on those points, as respects individual
careers, even in one so active and fruitful as
our subject's; for, so far as we know, there is
no history of the stage of that city which pretends
to do for its dramatic life what Ireland
has done for the New York stage&mdash;regarding
which monument of painstaking fidelity,
William Winter, in the preface to his recent
admirable volume on "The Jeffersons," truly
says: "Every writer who touches upon the
history of the drama in America must acknowledge
his obligation for guidance and
aid to the thorough, faithful and suggestive
records made by the veteran historian, Joseph
N. Ireland. "Yet, in depicting the career of
a great actor, many things are rendered subordinate
which in a history of the drama of any
given period would receive due prominence.
That the career of Burton in Philadelphia from
1834 to 1848 embraced much of its stage history
during those years, will, of course, be understood;
and we shall be sorry if our readers,
at the same time, fail to discern the industry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
sagacity, courage, and varied powers&mdash;with
which the actor, author, and manager, illustrated
those years&mdash;suggested by this recital.</p>

<p>We now approach a period within the memory
of many persons now living. Some few
octogenarians may survive who can recall Burton's
performances of over forty years ago; but
they must be few indeed; and their recollections
cannot be otherwise than dim and uncertain.
But the achievements of Burton in
Chambers Street; the unexampled popularity
of his theatre; the unequalled company he
gathered there; the indisputable creations of
character that there originated; the birth of a
revival of Shakespeare, with a felicity of conception
that revealed the appreciative student,
and with a beauty and minuteness of appointment
unprecedented at the time;&mdash;all this,
through a decade of years, forms an enchanting
reminiscence vivid still in the retrospect of numberless
New Yorkers. It is not surprising that
we of the city of New York forget that the
comedian so long belonged to Philadelphia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
So brilliant was his success in Chambers Street
that all other theatres where he flourished seem
to be viewed by the reflected light of that;
and we think there will be no question that
there were clustered his rarest triumphs and
there blossomed the flower of his fame.</p>

<h2>BURTON IN NEW YORK.</h2>

<p class="center">1848-1856.</p>

<p>Palmo's Opera-House was built in 1842,
and, according to Wemyss' Chronology, was
the sixteenth theatre erected in New York. It
was built by Ferdinand Palmo, and designed
for the presentation of Italian opera. To
Palmo, it is said, belongs the honor of having
first introduced that department of music in
the city. In 1844 he opened with "Lucia di
Lammermoor"; but the support given to his
venture was not generous, notwithstanding the
fact that wealth and fashion still resided in
Warren, Murray, and Beekman streets. The
time apparently was not ripe; the experiment
ended in financial ruin to Palmo, and the unfortunate
man never wholly recovered from
the blow. The house passed into divers hands,
and was the scene of a variety of entertainments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
for two or three years afterward. The
writer remembers distinctly going there of an
afternoon, when a boy, to a circus entertainment.
The place was at a low ebb in point of
popularity and attraction when the comedian
fixed upon it as his future professional home.
He rearranged, fitted it up, and adorned it, and
called it <span class="smcap">Burton's Theatre</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-6.jpg"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><img src="./images/1-6thumb.jpg" alt=" Palmo's Opera-House, afterward Burton's Theatre. (After a water-color drawing in

<div class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Palmo's Opera-House, afterward Burton's Theatre. (After a water-color drawing in

<p>It had no doubt long been a dream of the
manager to attain as nearly as possible to perfection
in the organization and direction of a
first-class theatre. His varied experience in
Philadelphia and elsewhere constantly suggested
an administration composed of members
equally valuable in their respective lines, and
forming an harmonious whole under an efficient
executive, as the best system of government
for the growth and development of dramatic
art; and perhaps during his reign in Chambers
Street he came as near the realization of that
dream as is permitted to human aspiration. In
confirmation of the foregoing, we quote a passage
from William B. Wood's Recollections,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
where, writing in 1854 of the evils of the star
system, he says: "Let me here remark, that I
am happy to see of late times&mdash;I mean within
the last few years&mdash;that the pernicious system
of which I speak, by carrying itself fairly out,
and by so breaking up all sound stock companies,
has finally destroyed itself....
To that intelligent manager, Mr. Burton, the
first credit is due. He has been striving for a
number of years in New York, as he had been
doing here in Philadelphia, to bring his theatre
to a proper system, based on the principles of
common sense and experience. With talents
of his own equalled by few stars, he has preferred
to ascertain whether the public could
not be better attracted by a good stock company
of combined talent, and every New
Yorker knows with what excellent effect he
has labored. His success, I am happy to learn,
has amply confirmed his reputation for dramatic
judgment."</p>

<p>We may supplement this by a paragraph
taken from Laurence Hutton's entertaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
volume of "Plays and Players." Describing in
glowing terms the production of Buckstone's
comedy of "Leap Year," at Burton's, March 1,
1850, Mr. Hutton says: "That our readers
may fully comprehend the subject and period
of which we write, it will be well to remind
them, perhaps, that the art of acting had
arrived at such a point in Burton's Theatre,
that, to play a comedy well, was not enough.
Every thing was so well done, so perfect in
every respect, mere excellence was so much a
matter of course, was so positive, on the
Chambers Street boards, that there was but
little room for the comparative, and the
superlative itself was necessary to create a
sensation."</p>

<p>The Chambers Street Theatre opened July
10, 1848, with "Maidens, Beware"; "Raising
the Wind," and "The Irish Dragoon." These
were succeeded by "New York in Slices,"
"Dan Keyser de Bassoon," and "Lucy Did
Sham Amour." The work was slow at first,
but the disappearance of money was rapid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
We have seen, however, that there was no
limit to Burton's energy and perseverance.
He played in New York, Philadelphia, and
Baltimore, week after week; managed, in conjunction
with John Brougham, an engagement
with Mr. W. C. Macready at Ford's Theatre,
Boston, October, 1848; was announced, on
Macready's departure, to appear himself; but
the intention was unfulfilled, and so it
chanced that he never acted there until the
last years of his life. He played for the
benefit of the widow and family of Edmund
Simpson, at the Park Theatre, December
7, 1848, in referring to which event
Mr. Ireland says: "We insert the entire
bill to show the forgetfulness of self evinced
by the volunteers, and their willingness to
assume any character to insure the best result,
there being no less than five gentlemen
in the cast who had played, and might justly
have laid claim to the principal character of
the play." The play was "The School for
Scandal," cast principally as follows:</p>

<p>This deed of charity was followed by others
for the same object on the part of New York
managers, and among them Burton contributed
a night at his own theatre, on the 5th of March
ensuing, in which the full strength of his company
appeared.</p>

<p>The burning of the Park Theatre in 1848
left Burton without a rival. The Olympic was
of the past; Forrest thundered at the Broadway;
Wallack's and Daly's were yet to be. It
was not long before the public discovered the
genius that presided in Chambers Street, and
recognized the unusual excellence which characterized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the performances. The location was
favorable for Brooklyn people, and from first
to last the theatre enjoyed a monopoly of their
patronage. "For several years," says Ireland,
"Burton's Theatre was the resort of the most
intelligent class of pleasure-seekers, and there
beauty, wit, and fashion, loved to congregate,
without the formality or etiquette of attire
once deemed necessary at the Park." Its fame
was really phenomenal. Leaping metropolitan
bounds, it spread to distant states and neighborhoods,
and became, one might almost say,
a familiar and welcome contribution to the
social and intellectual communion of the time.
For a stranger to come to New York in those
days and omit to visit Burton's, would imply
an obtuseness so forlorn, or an indifference so
stolid, that in the one case he would be an
object of compassion, and in the other a grave
offender of public sentiment. But in all probability
he looked forward during his journey
city-ward to his evening in those halls of
Momus; and we may be certain that the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quips, and cranks, and wanton wiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nods, and becks, and wreathèd smiles"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>of that night lived in his memory for many a
long day.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that this attraction
was almost wholly due to the extraordinary
powers of Burton himself. True, his
company embraced the finest artists in their
several lines of any stage in the country; and
it was well known to all lovers of refined drama
that the Chambers Street Theatre was the
home of English comedy, and that any given
play could be there produced with a cast entirely
adequate, and with a perfection of detail
ensuring to the auditor an artistic delight and
a representation of the highest class. But
there are many who, while appreciating the
delineation of manners and character, seek
amusement pure and simple, and who believe
that good digestion waits on hearty laughter.
To this large constituency Burton was the objective
point, for his humor and comic power
were a perennial fountain of mirth. His appearance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
either discovered when the curtain
rose, or entering from the wing, was the signal
for a ripple of merriment all over the house.
Every countenance brightened, the dullest
face glowed with gleeful expectancy. No
actor, we believe&mdash;unless possibly Liston,&mdash;ever
excelled Burton in humorous facial expression.
Tom Hood, in referring to certain
pastimes of a London evening, says in his
felicitous rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Or in the small Olympic pit sit, split,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughing at Liston, while you quiz his phiz."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Read the couplet thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Or in the <i>Chambers Street</i> snug pit sit, split,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughing at <i>Burton</i>, while you quiz his phiz,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and we have the nightly situation. It was a
common circumstance for the theatre to receive
accessions toward the close of the performance,
the new-comers standing in line along the walls,
drawn thither by the potent magnet of the
manager in the farce. Thus it was that, though
the theatre furnished constantly a rich feast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
comedy, and was more widely known than any
other, still more celebrated was the great actor
whose name it bore; and it was the magic of
that name that drew the people, and it was he
whom the people went to see. It seemed to
make little difference what the bills announced;
Burton would play,&mdash;and that was enough.</p>

<p>It was the privilege of the writer of these
pages to have free access to the Chambers
Street Theatre, and to know personally its
manager, and his recollections are such as to
induce him to believe that in no better way can
he perform his task of completing Mr. Burton's
career than by employing his own knowledge
and recording the impressions he received. In
so doing, the opportunity afforded for special
reference to members of his company will be
improved; and perhaps our retrospection may
arouse in other breasts a remembrance of past
delight.</p>

<p>Alluding to the comedian's first appearance
in New York, October 31, 1837, Joseph N. Ireland,
so often quoted, remarks: "The advent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of Mr. W. E. Burton, the most renowned comedian
of recent days, demands more than a passing
notice. For nearly twenty years no other
actor monopolized so much of the public
applause, and popular sentiment universally
assigned him a position in broad low comedy
entirely unrivalled on the American stage." It
was a little over three years between his arrival
in America and his New York débût; about
eleven between that appearance and his lesseeship
in Chambers Street; and eleven more
remain to be taken note of. Of these, eight
belong to Chambers Street, two to the uptown
theatre, and one to starring engagements in
various cities&mdash;the last being in Hamilton,
Canada, and abruptly terminated by the malady
of which he died.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The company at Chambers Street now demands
our attention; and the wish to suitably
recognize the talents, and to chronicle, however
simply, the triumphs of that famous array, has
constrained us to widen the scope of our original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
design, and to extend somewhat our notices
of certain individual actors. We shall in
nowise regret this; for in recalling past delight
it is a pleasure to dwell on those who caused it;
and we may, perchance, awaken thereby a
happy thought of them in other hearts. The
departed years are full of memories, and the
turning of a leaf may lay bare a volume of
reminiscence. It forms no part of our purpose,
however, to follow individual careers, and
to trace their course on other boards than those
of the Chambers Street Theatre. Many of them,
indeed, after Burton removed uptown, and after
his death, continued their successes and won renown
in other scenes and under other management;
and our readers may feel that but scant
justice is done many meritorious names familiar
to the present generation, in confining mention
of them to a period when their talents
and capabilities had not ripened to that excellence
which afterward gave them fame. But
we are concerned with them only as they figured
as members of Burton's company, and as such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
contributed richly to our fund of memory.
They stand in the dramatic Pantheon with
their great chief; and in approaching that
central and dominant figure we pause to
bend delighted gaze upon the admirable group
surrounding it.</p>

<p>From 1848 to 1856 the following names were
numbered on the muster-roll: Henry Placide,
Blake, Brougham, Lester, T. B. Johnston, Bland,
Jordan, Barrett, Dyott, Fisher, Thompson, Holland,
C. W. Clarke, Norton, Parsloe, Jr., Holman,
Charles Mathews, Setchell, Mrs. Hughes,
Mrs. Russell (now Mrs. Hoey), Mrs. Skerrett,
Mrs. Rea, Miss Raymond, Mrs. Hough, Mrs.
Buckland, Miss Weston, Miss Devlin, Miss
Malvina, Miss Agnes Robertson, Fanny Wallack,
Mary Taylor, Miss Chapman. This is
by no means intended as a complete enumeration&mdash;"but
't is enough, 't will serve." Many
names have been forgotten, and some remembered
but omitted. It may be of interest to
note at this point the fortunes that awaited
at least five of the actresses above named&mdash;viz.:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Mrs. Russell, Miss Weston, Miss Devlin,
Miss Malvina, Miss Agnes Robertson.</p>

<p>Mrs. Russell, while at Burton's in 1849, and
a great favorite, was married to John Hoey of
express fame, and shortly thereafter retired
from the stage, the manager doing the honors
at her farewell, and presenting her on the occasion
with a valuable testimonial of his regard.
Long afterward Mrs. Hoey was induced by the
elder Wallack to forsake her retirement, and
for many years was the leading lady at his
theatre, her refined manners, correct taste, and
exquisite toilets, exciting anew public esteem
and admiration. She quitted the stage and
returned to private life in 1865.</p>

<p>Miss Lizzie Weston, whose beauty, dramatic
aptitude, and versatility, won nightly plaudits,
and whose performance was not without much
that was highly meritorious, signalized a career
more or less checkered by uniting her fortunes
with those of the late Charles Mathews, during
his starring tour in 1858, and is now the widow
of that famous actor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Malvina, a sister of Mrs. Barney Williams,
was a <i>danseuse</i> at Burton's,&mdash;for it was
the fashion in the old days to beguile the lazy
time between the pieces with a Terpsichorean
interlude; and we remember but one instance
of her appearance in any other character, and
that was a minor part in the farce of "A School
for Tigers." She became Mrs. Wm. J. Florence
in 1853, and has since shared her husband's
fortunes and honors. Miss Agnes Robertson
made her débût in New York at the Chambers
Street Theatre, October 22, 1853, as <i>Milly</i> in
"The Young Actress," and has since been well
known as the wife of Dion Boucicault.</p>

<p>A more illustrious alliance&mdash;so soon to end
in piteous sorrow&mdash;was the portion of Mary
Devlin. She was a minor actress at Burton's,
but a woman of rare and lovely character. So
much so, that she won the heart of Edwin
Booth, and became his wife, and the idol of
his home, till death early called her from his
side. It was in memory of this sweet and
gentle lady, that the poet Thomas William Parsons
penned the following exquisite stanzas:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What shall we do now, Mary being dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or say, or write, that shall express the half?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What can we do but pillow that fair head<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And let the spring-time write her epitaph?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As it will soon in snow-drop, violet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wind-flower, and columbine, and maiden's tear,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each letter of that pretty alphabet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That spells in flowers the pageant of the year.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She was a maiden for a man to love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She was a woman for a husband's life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One that had learned to value far above<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The name of Love the sacred name of Wife.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her little life-dream, rounded so with sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had all there is of life&mdash;except gray hairs:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope, love, trust, passion, and devotion deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that mysterious tie a Mother bears.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She hath fulfilled her promise and hath past:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Set her down gently at the iron door!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyes! look on that loved image for the last:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now cover it in earth&mdash;her earth no more!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let us now summon, as first in order, the
name that heads the list of the actors above
given. Henry Placide enjoyed in public estimation
a fame worthy and well deserved. He
was an actor of the old school, and his conceptions
were the fruit of appreciative and careful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
study; his acting was a lucid and harmonious
interpretation of his author; and his elocution,
clear and resonant, was the speech of a scholar
and a gentleman. The artistic sense was never
forgotten in his delineations, and his name on
the bills was a guaranty of intellectual pleasure.
He was not broadly funny like Burton, or
Holland; but those who remember his <i>Sir
Harcourt Courtley</i>, his <i>Jean Jacques François
Antoine Hypolite de Frisac</i>, in "Paris and
London," and his <i>Clown</i>, in Shakespeare's
"Twelfth Night," will not deny that he was
the owner of a rich vein of eccentric humor,
and that he worked his possession effectually.
He was an expert in the Gallic parts where the
speech is a struggle between French and English,
and, indeed, since his departure they, too,
have vanished from the stage. But those who
saw him as <i>Haversac</i>, in "The Old Guard";
as <i>The Tutor</i>, in "To Parents and Guardians";
or as <i>Monsieur Dufard</i>, in "The First Night,"
will bear witness to his inimitable manner, and
to his facile blending of the grave and gay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
We shall never forget how, in the last-named
character (<i>Mons. Dufard</i>), having engaged his
daughter for a "first appearance," and having
declared his own ability to manage the drum
in the orchestra on the occasion, he, suddenly,
during the mimic rehearsal, at an allusion in
the text to sunrise, stamped violently on the
stage; and to the startled manager's exclamation
of "What's that!" serenely replied: "Zat
ees ze cannon vich announce ze brek of day&mdash;I
play him on ze big drum in ze night." In
choleric old men Placide was unsurpassed. All
the touches that go toward the creation of a
grim, irascible, thwarted, bluff old gentleman,
he commanded at will. His <i>Colonel Hardy</i>,
in "Paul Pry," for instance, what an example
was that! I hear him, now, at the close of the
comedy, when things had drifted to a happy
anchorage&mdash;hear him saying in reply to the
soothing remark: "Why, Colonel, you've
every thing your own way,"&mdash;"Yes, I know I
have every thing my own way; but&mdash;&mdash; it, I
hav'n't <i>my own way</i> of having it!" His repertory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
covered a wide range; and we retain
vivid recollections of his <i>Sir Peter Teazle</i>, his
<i>Doctor Ollapod</i>, and his <i>Silky</i>; the last in "The
Road to Ruin," in which comedy, by the way,
we remember seeing Placide, Blake, Burton,
Lester, Bland, and Mrs. Hughes; truly a phenomenal
cast.</p>

<p>Such, briefly sketched, was the actor who
constituted one of Burton's strongest pillars.
For some years he played at no other theatre
in New York. He gave enjoyment to thousands,
and in dramatic annals his name and
achievements have distinguished and honorable
record. As one of the many who remain to
own their debt of pleasure and instruction,
the present writer pays this tribute to the
genius and memory of Henry Placide.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>We now summon another name from the
famous corps, for the purpose of analysis, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
we should be ill content with the cold respect
of a passing glance at an artist so celebrated
as was William Rufus Blake. We can recall
no actor of the past, and we know of but one
in the present, comparable with Blake in certain
lines of old men&mdash;certainly in the rôle of
tender pathos like <i>Old Dornton</i>, and in the
portrayal of a sweetly noble nature framed in
venerable simplicity, as in <i>Jesse Rural</i>, he had
no equal; and it is simply truth to say that
with him departed from the stage that unique,
all-affecting, wondrous embodiment of <i>Geoffrey
Dale</i>, in "The Last Man."</p>

<p>The characteristics of Blake's power were a
broad heartiness, suggestive sentiment, and
eloquent idealization. These traits informed
respectively the parts he essayed, and gave to
each in turn rare flow of spirit, richness of
color, and poetic fervor. For the verbal expression
of these salient elements, he possessed
a tuneful voice, which rose or fell
as the sway of feeling dictated, and his delivery
was singularly felicitous in tone and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
emphasis. Nor was he lacking in a humor at
once subtle and delicate, happily evinced in
his acting of <i>Mr. Primrose</i>, in the comedietta
of "Bachelors' Torments."</p>

<p>Those who saw Blake at the period of which
we are writing, found it hard to believe that
the <i>Sir Anthony Absolute</i> of aldermanic proportions
before them was once a slender young
man and played light comedy! Yet so it was.
Very old play-goers will recollect the Chatham
Garden theatre, and perhaps some tenacious
memory bears record of having seen Blake there
in the long ago; for there he first appeared
to a New York audience, in 1824, playing
<i>Frederick</i>, in Colman's "Poor Gentleman."
We never saw him earlier than at Burton's,
and then with added years had come a rotundity
of person which, however unobjectionable
in the famous impersonations of his
prime, was not, it must be confessed, the ideal
physique of light comedy; so his <i>Frederick</i>
had long departed and his <i>Sir Robert Bramble</i>
had appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The first time we saw Blake was in "The
Road to Ruin," and the impression he made
has never been effaced. We were young, it is
true, and sentimental, and easily moved; but
our heart tells us that the effect would be the
same could we see the actor in the play
to-morrow. We have read since of the extraordinary
sensation produced by the great Munden
in the part of <i>Old Dornton</i>; but we have
an abiding faith that the acting of the famous
Englishman would have been no revelation to
Blake; and we cannot, indeed, conceive of any
added touch that would not have impaired,
rather than heightened, the latter's superb
delineation. But Blake's portrayal of the outraged,
doting, fond, tender father, is, like his
<i>Jesse Rural</i>, so fresh in the memory of living
persons, that we feel it to be needless to descant
upon its beauties. Few will forget the
years of his last and long engagement at Wallack's&mdash;a
fitting crown for a great artistic career.
Blake played many parts and rarely touched
but to adorn. Even his <i>Malvolio</i>, had it not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
been for the advent of Charles Fisher (who was
born in yellow stockings and cross-gartered),
would have passed into history as a carefully
conceived and highly finished performance.
Whenever we see Mr. John Gilbert we are reminded
of Blake. There is a grace of action, a
courtliness of manner, inseparable from Gilbert,
which lends to all his efforts an elevating
charm, a feature Blake did not possess in like
degree. But the two actors belonged to the
same school; their traditions will be much
akin; and neither loses in being spoken of in
the same breath, and with the same accent of
admiration.</p>

<p>Following Placide and Blake is the name of
an actor better remembered than either, and
whose death is of comparatively recent date.
We refer to John Brougham, who for thirty
years and more was one of New York's prime
favorites, and his name is associated with many
of the drama's brightest and worthiest triumphs.
His inexhaustible flow of spirits, in
his best days, pervaded all his acting, and invested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the most unattractive part with an alluring
charm, as many a prosaic spot in nature
becomes enchanted land by the music of falling
waters. Add to this exuberant vitality a
rich endowment of mother wit; a bright intelligence;
keen sympathy and appreciation, and
rare personal magnetism, and you have before
you "glorious John," whose hearty voice it
was always a pleasure to hear, and whose face,
beaming with humor, was always welcomed
with delight.</p>

<p>Brougham was Burton's stage manager in
1848, and his dramatization of "Dombey and
Son" was first produced in that year. The
representation of this play established the
Chambers Street Theatre, drew attention to
the talents of the stock company, and put
money into Burton's purse. If theatres, like
other things, succeed either by hook or crook,
as the saying is, surely it was by hook that the
manager won fame and fortune, for the digit of
<i>Captain Cuttle</i> held sway like a wizard's wand.
The temptation to dwell here on this renowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Burtonian impersonation is hard to resist; but
we must be patient and bide our time.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-7.jpg"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><img src="./images/1-7thumb.jpg" alt="Mr. Burton as Captain Cuttle."></img></span></a></div>

<div class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Mr. Burton as Captain Cuttle.</span></div>

<p>Brougham played <i>Bunsby</i> and <i>Bagstock</i>, investing
the oracular utterances of the tar, and
the roughness and toughness and "devilish"
slyness of the <i>Major</i>, with a humor and spirit
all his own. We laugh outright as we think
of that scene where <i>Cuttle</i> is being rapidly
reduced to agony and despair by <i>Mrs. MacStinger</i>,
and is rescued therefrom by <i>Bunsby</i>,
who, with a hoarse "Avast, my lass; avast!"
advances solemnly on the redoubtable female,
and with a soothing gravity ejects the entire
<i>MacStinger</i> family, following in the rear himself&mdash;<i>Cuttle</i>
meanwhile gazing in speechless astonishment
at the unexpected succor, until the
door is closed; and then, drawing an immense
breath, and turning toward the audience his
inimitable face, exclaims in a tone of profound
respect and admiration: "There's wisdom!"</p>

<p>It was a great treat to see Burton and
Brougham together. The two actors were so
ready, so full of wit, so alive to each other's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
points and by-play, that any fanciful interpolation
of the text, or humorous impromptu, by
the one, was instantly responded to by the
other; and the house was often thrown into
convulsions of merriment by these purely unpremeditated
sallies. This was notably the
case in the afterpiece of "An Unwarrantable
Intrusion"&mdash;committed by Mr. Brougham upon
Mr. Burton&mdash;when in the tag the comedians
suddenly assumed their own persons, and,
addressing each other by their proper names,
engaged in a droll colloquy respecting the
dilemma of having nothing to say to conclude
the piece; and each suggesting in turn something
that ought to or might be said to an audience
under such peculiar and distressing circumstances,&mdash;the
audience meanwhile in a state of
hilarious excitement, drinking in every sparkling
jest and repartee, and wishing the flow of
humor would last forever.</p>

<p>And here we are reminded of an incident not
down in the bills, which furnished an audience
with an unlooked-for and affecting episode. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
occurred during the performance of Colman's
comedy of "John Bull," produced for the
benefit of a favorite actor; Burton playing <i>Job
Thornberry</i>, and Brougham, who had volunteered
for the occasion, appearing in his capital
rôle of <i>Dennis Brulgruddery</i>. Brougham was no
longer with Burton&mdash;an estrangement existed
between them of which the public was aware&mdash;and
the conjunction of the two actors naturally
awakened a lively interest. It chances
in the comedy that <i>Mary Thornberry</i> finds a
refuge in her distress at the "Red Cow," and
is greatly befriended by <i>Dennis</i>. Her father,
discovering her there, and grateful for the service
rendered, exclaims: "You have behaved
like an emperor to her. Give me your hand,
landlord!" Now, in the play, the reply of
<i>Dennis</i> is: "Behaved!&mdash;(<i>refusing his hand</i>)&mdash;Arrah,
now, get away with your blarney,"&mdash;but
Brougham paused for a moment before Burton's
outstretched hand, and then, as if yielding
to an impulse, stretched forth his, and the
two actors stood with clasped hands amidst an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
outburst of applause that fairly shook the
building. Of course they were "called out"
at the close, and Brougham, in the course of
a felicitous little speech, remarked&mdash;alluding,
perhaps, to the success of his Lyceum not
being all he could wish&mdash;that he had "lately
run off the track"; to which Burton, in his
turn, responded by saying: "Mr. Brougham
says he has 'run off the track.' Well, he <i>has</i>
run off the track; but he hasn't burst his boiler
yet!" At this speech the enthusiasm of the
audience knew no bounds; and indeed, with
the exception of Mary Taylor's farewell benefit,
we can recall no theatrical occasion where more
genuine feeling was manifested.</p>

<p>But to return to "Dombey and Son." Mrs.
Brougham was the original <i>Susan Nipper</i>, and
played the part acceptably; but all previous
<i>Nippers</i> suffered eclipse when Caroline Chapman
appeared at a later date, giving us a <i>Susan</i>
that seemed to have sprung full-<i>Nippered</i> from
the head of Boz himself. Her inimitable acting
and ring of delivery were like a new light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
turned on the scene. Her flow of spirit and
alert movement, her independent air and saucy
glance, her not-to-be-put-down-under-any-circumstances
manner,&mdash;all was freshness and
sparkle, and her presence was as welcome to the
audience as a summer shower to drooping
wayside flowers. Miss Chapman was a great
acquisition to Burton's, and her bright individuality
shone in all her assumptions. Her
line was the stage soubrette, a specialty which
she lifted entirely out of the commonplace and
informed it with force and distinction. It is a
pleasure to place on record the memory of
happy hours that we owe to the performances
of Caroline Chapman.</p>

<p>The original <i>Toots</i> was Oliver B. Raymond,
whom we never saw. T. B. Johnston was his
successor, and as that admirable comedian
never did any thing unacceptably, his <i>Toots</i>
was a memorable effort; and had <i>Uriah Heep</i>
not followed we should have been satisfied
with his <i>Toots</i>; but when "Copperfield" was
produced and Johnston appeared as <i>Heep</i>, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
seemed as if he was born for that and nothing
else. Now that we think of it, it seems to us,
as we recall Johnston, that nature had peculiarly
fitted him for the delineation of many of
Dickens's characters. Something in his spare
figure, his grotesqueness of demeanor, his
whimsical aspect, his odd manner of speech,
continually suggested a flavor of Boz; and
whether as <i>Toots</i>, or <i>Heep</i>, or <i>Newman Noggs</i>, he
seemed to have glided into his element, and
was <i>en rapport</i> with the great novelist.</p>

<p>We must not forget, in writing of "Dombey
and Son," to note how much its attraction was
enhanced by the assumption, in 1849, of the
part of <i>Edith</i> by Mrs. Josephine Russell (the
present Mrs. Hoey). Laurence Hutton, referring
to the event in his volume of "Plays
and Players," says: "Up to the time of
her assumption of the rôle, <i>Edith</i>, in Brougham's
version of the story, was comparatively
a secondary part, and one to which but
little attention had been paid either by performer
or audience. Mrs. Russell, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
by her refined and elegant manner, brought
<i>Edith</i> and herself into favor and prominence.
She made of <i>Edith</i> more than Brougham himself
ever imagined could be made; and <i>Edith</i>
made her a reputation and a success on the
New York stage, which, until her honorable
and much-to-be-regretted retirement, she ever
sustained.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>We have dwelt thus on "Dombey and Son,"
because, in the first place, it gained for the
Chambers Street Theatre an enduring public
regard, and was no doubt the incentive to the
after-production of dramatizations of Dickens,
which gave us Burton in <i>Micawber</i>, <i>Squeers</i>,
<i>Mr. Bumble</i>, and <i>Sam Weller</i>; and because in
so celebrating it we pay a deserved tribute to
Brougham, from whose fertile brain and ready
pen it came. We may say, in this connection,
that not only as actor, but as playwright also,
Brougham achieved fame and honor. Many
of his comedies are well known to the stage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and are included in the published drama; and
as a writer of burlesque we question whether
any thing better or funnier than his "Po-ca-hon-tas
or the Gentle Savage" has ever
been composed. Of one thing we are certain:
an incarnate pun-fiend presided over its creation.
This extravaganza, first acted at Wallack's
Lyceum, took the town by storm, and its bons-mots,
local hits, and trenchant witticisms, were
on the lips of everybody. In structure, idea,
and treatment of theme, it was ludicrous to a
degree. Who does not remember Brougham
and the late Charles Walcot in their respective
parts of <i>Powhattan</i> and <i>Captain Smith</i>?</p>

<p>It goes without saying that Brougham's
Hibernian delineations were perfect and to the
manner born. Many an Irish farce we recall,
during his stay at Burton's, to which he gave a
new lease of life; and we congratulate ourselves
that our memory holds record of having
once seen him as <i>Sir Lucius O'Trigger</i>, the
only cast in our experience wherein Sheridan's
creation found a fitting representative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>We now pause before an actor of illustrious
lineage; of a name honored in dramatic annals
by encomiums bestowed only upon abilities of
the highest order; an actor who, conscious
of his inheritance of genius, worthily perpetuates
the traditions of his house; and who is
now, despite the flight of time, the most engaging
and accomplished comedian known to the
American stage. Our readers will need no
further introduction to Lester Wallack, the
"Mr. Lester" of Burton's, where first we saw
him so many years ago. We recall the evening
when we sat in the cosy parquette, awaiting
with eager interest the rising of the curtain on
Charles Dance's comic drama of "Delicate
Ground," in which Mr. Lester would make his
"first appearance since his return from England"
(so the bill ran), in the character of
<i>Citizen Sangfroid</i>. We say eager interest, for
we had heard much of Mr. Lester: that he
was graceful, handsome, <i>distingué</i>,&mdash;in fact,
splendid generally; and our expectancy was
akin to that of the watching astronomer&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When a new planet swims into his ken."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At last the tinkle of the bell; the curtain
rose, and enter Miss Mary Taylor, the universal
favorite, as <i>Pauline</i>. Her soliloquy closes with
the cue for <i>Sangfroid's</i> entrance, and at the
words, "Hush! my husband!" a pause succeeded&mdash;and
then from "door left" was protruded
an elegantly booted foot, and a moment
later Lester stood before us, bowing with characteristic
ease and grace to the demonstrations
of welcome. We confess to an unconditional
surrender on that occasion. The actual fact
was far beyond any expectation or hope. We
thought we had never seen any one quite so
splendid; and <i>Sangfroid</i> was forthwith invested
with the best and noblest elements that
combine to elevate mankind. We endeavored
for many days afterward to conform our daily
life to the general teachings of <i>Sangfroid</i>; we
imitated the gait and manner, the calm aplomb
of <i>Sangfroid</i>; the accent of <i>Sangfroid</i> was
impressed on all our ordinary forms of speech;
our conversation on whatever topic was plentifully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
sprinkled with <i>Sangfroidisms</i>; in short,
the whole tenor of our existence was shaped
and directed by <i>Sangfroid</i> in the person of Mr.
Lester. We recovered in due course from our
abject submission to the spell of <i>Sangfroid</i>;
but Lester continued to stretch forth the
"sceptre of fascination," and to his matchless
grace and finish we owe many a delightful
recollection.</p>

<p>Then in early manhood,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
the unrestrained
alertness and vivacity of youth were his in
bounteous measure. He was in the <i>Percy
Ardent</i> and <i>Young Rapid</i> period, and had not
yet entered the corridor of years at the far end
of which lurked the <i>blasé</i> figure of "My Awful
Dad." We remember him in so many parts
which in all likelihood he never will play again!
There was <i>Rover</i>, in "Wild Oats," that buskined
hero, with his captivating nonchalance dashed
with tragic fire; his tender conversion of <i>Lady
Amaranth</i>&mdash;played, be it said, with all proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
demureness by Miss Lizzie Weston; his triumph
over <i>Ephraim Smooth</i>&mdash;one of Blake's
instances of versatility&mdash;in a scene rich with
the spirit of frolic abandon; and his humorous
tilt with <i>Sir George Thunder</i>&mdash;a belligerent
sea-dog, played by Burton as he alone could
play it&mdash;an episode replete with comic power;&mdash;all
these contributed to a performance which
we revelled in many and many a night; and
the memory of it, now as we write, draws near
in a succession of vivid pictures. There was
<i>Tangent</i>, in "The Way to Get Married," a
capital part in Lester's hands, blending manly
action and debonair grace with that easy transition
to airy farcical expression, a favorite and
effective dramatic habit of this actor, and given
full play in that memorable prison scene in the
comedy, when, a victim to adverse circumstances,
and actually fettered, he makes felicitous
use of his handkerchief to hide his mortification
and his chains from the eyes of the
heroine during her visit of sympathy. <i>Percy
Ardent</i>, in "The West End," was another of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
his characteristic assumptions in those days;
so also were <i>Young Rapid</i>, in "A Cure for the
Heartache," and the <i>Hon. Tom Shuffleton</i>, in
"John Bull"; and, indeed, Burton's frequent
revivals of the old comedies would have been a
difficult matter without Lester; for in every
one of them a light comedy part is distinctly
drawn, and unquestionably the rarest among
all dramatic artists is the first-class light
comedian.</p>

<p>Let any one who thinks otherwise endeavor
to recall the names of those who have been or
are famous in that special line, and he will be
surprised to find how few he can enumerate.
One might suppose that all young actors would
naturally incline toward light comedy, and be
ambitious in that direction, since in that sphere
are found the charm of youth, the expression
of lofty sentiment, the impulse to chivalrous
action, the opportunity for the display of
graceful and manly bearing,&mdash;not to mention
the lover, whom, as Emerson declares, all the
world loves; and why then, one may ask,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
should there not be always a plentiful crop of
ripening light comedians? Alas, it is not
enough to be young, good-looking, intelligent,
and of virtuous impulse, or even a lover.
Something more is needed, and we conceive
it to be that gift of nature, which study and
practice develop into seeming perfect art, but
which neither study nor practice can create;
the gift, let us say, of perceiving instinctively
the salient points of a character, and going beyond
the author in felicitous and suggestive
expression of them. It is easier, we think, to
compass tragedy; easier to simulate age;
easier to be funny; than to be at once airy
and gay, delicately humorous, and engagingly
manly. There are fewer light comedians
born,&mdash;that is the whole story; and where we
find one actor like Lester Wallack, we meet
with plenty of every other specialty. This
was made strikingly evident by Burton's experiments
in supplying Lester's place, when the
latter joined his father in the establishment of
Wallack's Lyceum. Charles Fisher was imported,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and he for a season essayed to succeed
Lester; but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The expectancy and rose of the fair state"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he was not, and it was not long before the
fiddle of <i>Triplet</i> and the yellow stockings of
<i>Malvolio</i> emancipated him from the bondage
of light comedy, revealed his true powers, and
made us grateful to Burton for introducing to
New York one of the best eccentric comedians
of the day. Dyott, Norton, and even Holman,
were severally thrown into the breach, such
was the strait in which the manager found
himself; and it was not until he secured George
Jordan that equilibrium was restored to the
company.</p>

<p>But to return. The versatility of Lester, so
conspicuous throughout his career, was early
made apparent. We remember him as <i>Steerforth</i>,
as <i>Sir Andrew Aguecheek</i>, and <i>Captain
Murphy Maguire</i>; and though in the last he
acted under the shadow of Brougham's rich
impersonation, still he was a delightful <i>Captain</i>.
We saw him as the young lover, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
"Paul Pry"; as <i>Frederick</i>, in "The Poor Gentleman,"
and many more; besides those parts,
such as <i>Young Marlow</i>, <i>Charles Surface</i>, and
<i>Captain Absolute</i>, which need no reference,
since they remain ripe and finished conceptions
in his present repertory. But of all his
delineations of the past, that which we linger
on with the greatest pleasure, and which
affected us most, was his <i>Harry Dornton</i>, in
"The Road to Ruin." From the moment he
appears beneath his father's window, importunate
for admittance, he awakens an interest
and sympathy that follow him to the end.
The part abounds in touches of Lesterian hue
and flavor: the scene just mentioned; that
wherein <i>Milford</i> makes careless and heartless
allusion to <i>Old Dornton</i>, and is met by <i>Harry's</i>
eloquent and electric rebuke; the scene with
the <i>Widow Warren</i>, and with <i>Sophia</i>;&mdash;all are
charming; and we feel it to be no small tribute
to hold in memory Lester's <i>Harry</i> side by side
with the <i>Old Dornton</i> of Blake.</p>

<p>We have spoken of T. B. Johnston, and referred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to famous parts of his, particularly to
the conception and execution of certain characters
in Dickens which undeniably he made
his own; but we remember this actor in other
and sundry enjoyable delineations, of which
brief mention may be made. The odd aspect
of Johnston, joined to his whimsical method,
so in keeping, as before remarked, with the
creations of Boz, peculiarly fitted him for the
apt portrayal of those idiosyncrasies of nature
and temperament shadowed forth by characters
in many of the old farces, in which he often
appeared, those pieces being quite the fashion
in the days of which we are writing. We may
instance <i>Panels</i>, in "A School for Tigers," as
one of these; his part in "A Blighted Being"
(the name quite forgotten), was another;
<i>Humphrey Dobbins</i>, in "The Poor Gentleman"
(that not a farce, however), was a capital portraiture,
and an amusing foil to Burton's <i>Sir
Robert Bramble</i>; his <i>Miss Swithers</i>, in "A
Thousand Milliners," where he almost divided
the honors with Burton as <i>Madam Vandepants</i>;&mdash;these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
are a few of the many that come
floating back on the tide of recollection.</p>

<p>Bland was a useful member of Burton's
company, though we think his stay was brief,
and he contributes less to memory, as it
chances, than many others. We never regarded
him as a great actor, though we have read
of his being thought the best <i>Jacques</i> of his
day, and very fine as <i>Sir Thomas Clifford</i>. We
never saw him in either, and have no recollection
of "The Hunchback" being produced at
the Chambers Street Theatre. In "The Honeymoon"
Burton himself was the <i>Jacques</i>.
We remember Bland very well as <i>Sulky</i>, in
"The Road to Ruin," and as <i>Ham</i>, in "David
Copperfield," and both efforts were creditable
and contributed to the general success&mdash;his
share in the exciting and touching scenes between
<i>Old Dornton</i> and himself, as <i>Sulky</i>, being
admirably done.</p>

<p>We are surprised that we remember so little
interesting to record of Jordan. Succeeding
Lester, and deemed by many the peer of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
comedian, one might naturally suppose that his
achievements would figure largely in these
reminiscences; but we can recall very few impersonations
of which we retain a vivid impression.
We cannot concur with that estimate of
his powers which ranked him with Lester, yet
we cordially admit that he came nearer than
any actor we know of. He was very handsome,
had a fine stage presence, and was agreeable
in all that he did. We recall his spirited
performance of <i>Rover</i>; his <i>Kitely</i>, in Ben
Jonson's "Every Man in His Humor"; his
<i>Ferdinand</i>, in "The Tempest"; his <i>Lysander</i>,
in "Midsummer Night's Dream"; and his
<i>Captain Hawksley</i>, in "Still Waters Run
Deep," was superb and unequalled. It was
always a pleasure to see Jordan, and we owe to
his acting many an hour of enjoyment.</p>

<p>George Barrett&mdash;or, "Gentleman George,"
as he was quite as well known&mdash;was one of
Burton's company for a short period, and with
his name are associated many pleasant memories.
Among them we may mention with delight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
his performance of <i>Sir Andrew Aguecheek</i>,
a companion picture to Fisher's <i>Malvolio</i>.
His long body and attenuated "make
up," his piping voice, his fantastic manner,
and absurd assumption of acumen,&mdash;all contributed
to an embodiment artistic and entertaining
in the highest degree. He also played
<i>Flute</i>, the Bellows-Mender, in the revival of
"Midsummer Night's Dream"; and it seems
but yesterday, so vivid is the remembrance,
that we saw him stalking about the stage, in
the guise of Ben Jonson's bombastic hero,
<i>Captain Bobadil</i>.</p>

<p>Old play-goers, if they remember nothing
else of John Dyott, will recollect his admirable
reading&mdash;his distinct utterance&mdash;his
fine emphasis,&mdash;qualities specially noticeable in
his Shakespearian assumptions and in characters
of a didactic cast; and which made acceptable
many a part he undertook, half redeeming
it from deficiencies consequent upon natural
unfitness. It was such a pleasure to listen to
his delivery of the text, that you overlooked or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
pardoned inadequacy of treatment in other respects.
Necessarily his impersonations were
of very unequal merit. Certain phases of the
character assumed might be justly conceived
and well executed; others manifestly lacking
in the expression of what was naturally suggested,
or sufficiently obvious. We might cite
instances of this&mdash;<i>Claude Melnotte</i> or <i>Alfred
Evelyn</i>, for example; but we prefer to think of
him in his most agreeable aspects, which were
not conspicuous in light comedy, though that
rôle, under the stress of exigency, often fell to
his lot.</p>

<p>We pleasantly recall him as <i>Lieut. Worthington</i>,
in "The Poor Gentleman"; as <i>Peregrine</i>,
in "John Bull"; as <i>Penruddoch</i>, in
"The Wheel of Fortune"; as <i>Duke Orsino</i>,
in "Twelfth Night"; as <i>Master Ford</i>, in
"The Merry Wives of Windsor"; and others
that might be mentioned. He was a useful
member of the Chambers Street company,
acted always with intelligence and spirit, and,
though leaving no great name, deserves remembrance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
as a finished reader and conscientious
artist.</p>

<p>Charles Fisher, well known to the present
generation of play-goers as a sterling comedian,
came to Burton's after Lester's withdrawal,
and, as previously remarked, succeeded that
actor as the exponent of light comedy. We
saw him in several characters of that order;
but it must be confessed that his efforts, however
praiseworthy, were not such as to induce
a condition of complacency on the part of the
management, with regard to his capacity in
that direction. But the whirligig of time, as
Shakespeare tells us, brings on its revenges;
and in due course Mr. Fisher had his, and a
truly artistic one it was.</p>

<p>It came about on the second revival of
"Twelfth Night," and was achieved in the
part of <i>Malvolio</i>. In referring to Blake's assumption
of this character, we observed, in
passing, that Fisher was born in yellow stockings
and cross-gartered&mdash;meaning to express
the natural affinity for Shakespeare's creation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
existing in the actor; and we believe there
will be no question among those who remember
the impersonation, as to the subtlety of
conception, the felicity of portrayal, and fidelity
to detail, that so eminently distinguished it.
From first to last it was a masterpiece. His
manner when he interrupts the orgies of <i>Sir
Toby</i>, the <i>Clown</i>, and <i>Aguecheek</i>, and during
their maudlin mockery, was full of rare suggestiveness;
the great scene in the garden,
where he falls into the trap set by <i>Maria</i>, was
one of the finest pieces of acting known to our
stage. The audience were as intent during
its progress as if their own lives and fortunes
hung upon that enigmatic letter. When it
comes home to him at last that he indeed is
the favored of <i>Olivia</i>, and he gives full rein to
his fancy respecting his future exaltation&mdash;how
he must bear himself, the lofty air he will
assume, the consideration he will extort,&mdash;he
was inimitable. Already he is clothed in yellow
stockings and cross-gartered; and he
smiles, as he struts, the smile that his deceiver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
declares so becomes him. In the ensuing
scene before <i>Olivia</i>, where the stockings
and smiles play so important a part, he was
equally fine; and if Fisher had played nothing
else, his <i>Malvolio</i> would remain an interpretation
of the highest class, and a glory of dramatic
art. The press, with one accord, united
in its praise; and Mr. Richard Grant White,
whose ability to judge of Shakespearian delineations
was well known, confessed, in the
columns of the <i>Courier and Inquirer</i> that he
did not know where Mr. Fisher learned to
play <i>Malvolio</i> so well. To say that we enjoyed
what we have here endeavored to recall, is to
say but little. It is one of our most valued
memories&mdash;and we could not help thinking,
when the lovely <i>Viola</i> of the late Miss Neilson
was captivating all hearts, what a revelation it
would have been to her admiring audience had
Fisher presented his picture of <i>Malvolio</i>.</p>

<p>In Burton's revival of the "Midsummer
Night's Dream," Fisher was cast as <i>Duke Theseus</i>;
and in thinking of the part, that glorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
passage descriptive of the <i>Duke's</i> hounds rings
in our ears, as spoken with glowing enthusiasm
by the actor:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So flew'd, so sanded; and their heads are hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ears that sweep away the morning dew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crook-kneed, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each under each. A cry more tunable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was never holloa'd to, nor cheered with horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judge when you hear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In "The Tempest" also, as <i>Prospero</i>, Mr.
Fisher appeared to advantage, and swayed the
destinies of the Enchanted Isle with dignity
and effect. <i>Triplet</i>, in "Masks and Faces,"
was another performance of Fisher's that we
might linger over in pleasant memory of its
humor and pathos; a performance, too, by the
way, which brought to public view a new
accomplishment of the actor; namely, his acquaintance
with the violin,&mdash;an advantage that
lent unusual force and brilliancy to the capital
scene where <i>Woffington</i>, having played Lady
Bountiful to the forlorn family, completes her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
conquest by calling for the fiddle and dancing
"Cover the Buckle." And with the tune in
our ears, and a vision of Fisher's elbow in deft
movement, we take leave of the actor who
gave us in the past so many happy hours.</p>

<p>An artist of quite another sort was Lysander
Steele Thompson. He was an importation of
Burton's; and his specialty was the Yorkshireman
of the stage, a line in which he stood alone
and unapproachable. Actors there have been
who played the same parts, and with a sufficient
mastery of the dialect to pass muster;
but, compared with Thompson's, their assumptions
were like artificial flowers in a painted
vase beside a clump of spring violets in the
dew of morning. The semblance was there;
but the delicious fragrance of nature's breath
it was not theirs to give. The native freshness
and out-of-door breezy spirit were Thompson's
own and born with him. His engagement was
followed by the production of all the known
plays in which there was a <i>Zekiel Homespun</i>, or
a <i>Robin Roughhead</i>. We saw him in them all:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<i>Bob Tyke</i>, in "The School of Reform"; <i>Zekiel
Homespun</i>, in "The Heir-at-Law"; <i>Stephen
Harrowby</i>, in "The Poor Gentleman,"&mdash;and
until the advent of Thompson, the <i>Harrowby</i>
family had been omitted in Burton's version of
the comedy;&mdash;<i>Robin Roughhead</i>, in "A Ploughman
Turned Lord"; <i>John Browdie</i>, in "Nicholas
Nickleby"; and <i>Giles</i>, in "The Miller's
Maid"; in which last, indeed, he acted under
an inspiration that almost laid claim to genius
itself; and we see him now, in that high-wrought
scene, where, as the defender of virtue and
innocence, he towers in superb wrath above
the villain <i>Gamekeeper</i>, who would tear from
her home the person of <i>Susan Fellows</i>.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that his dialect was
perfect, and all the humorous phases&mdash;the
touches of bewilderment and arch simplicity,
the quaint retort, the rollicking drollery, the
innocence blent with audacity,&mdash;all these traits
and characteristics were so many gifts of expression
summoned and employed at will. We
have seen many tragedians and artists in melodrama;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
many "old men" and light comedians;
many funny men and eccentric actors, but we
have seen one Yorkshireman only&mdash;Lysander
Thompson.</p>

<p>He was not without vanity, however, and
possibly aspired to other dramatic walks than
his famous specialty, if we may judge from a
little episode in his career at Burton's, which
really makes too good a story to be lost. Burton
had in view the production of "The Merry
Wives," in order to act <i>Falstaff</i>; and in the
distribution Thompson was asked to make
choice of a part. The story runs that, after
due reflection, Mr. Thompson answered that on
the whole he would prefer to play <i>Sir John</i>.
The manager regarded him for a moment with
a glance of wonder, and then: "I'm&mdash;&mdash; if
you do; one <i>Falstaff</i> is enough; you must
choose again, Thompson." And he chose the
<i>Host of the Garter Inn</i>, and made a palpable
hit.</p>

<p>The late Charles Mathews played a short engagement
at Burton's; and we remember his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
capital acting in "Little Toddlekins" and as
<i>Young Rapid</i>; but we need not dwell upon an
actor whose stay was so fleeting, whose celebrity
was so extended, and whose Memoirs have
so recently been given to the public.</p>

<p>George Holland, also departed, was for a
brief period at the Chambers Street Theatre,
and we recall our enjoyment of his broad fun
and facial extravagance. We always felt, however,
that&mdash;as his line was somewhat akin to
Burton's&mdash;he underwent a perilous ordeal in
appearing on the same stage with the great
actor whose genius was so overshadowing.</p>

<p>Messrs. Norton,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Holman, and Parsloe, Jr.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
were useful members of the stock company,
limited in range and ability; and we mention
them as painstaking actors, who always did
their best, and aided materially in the general
success of the theatre. The name of young
Parsloe is included on account of his performance
of <i>Puck</i>, which, owing to natural cleverness
and acrobatic aptitude, he succeeded, under
Burton's training, in making exceedingly
effective and full of goblin action.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>And now let us fancy ourselves sitting, as of
old, in the parquette, the curtain having risen
on "The Serious Family." <i>Sleek</i> reads his
appeal, and we hear a voice saying: "Those
words give comfort to every fainting and
world-worn spirit, good Mr. Aminadab Sleek"&mdash;and
we know that <i>Lady Sowerby Creamly</i>
has spoken, and that Mrs. Hughes is before us.
Of this estimable lady and admirable actress,
much more might be said than present space
will allow. Almost as familiar a figure as the
manager himself, for years she enacted those
characters which were peculiarly her forte, and
was identified with all the success and shared
all the fame of the renowned theatre. We can
recall no instance of her having disappointed
an audience; and though, in the course of her
long service, she may have assumed uncongenial
parts, yet so intelligent was she, so
thorough, so conscientious, that, in spite of unsuitableness,
her performance was always acceptable
and meritorious. <i>Lady Duberly</i>, in
"The Heir-at-Law," <i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>, in "The
Rivals," <i>Lucretia McTab</i>, in "The Poor Gentleman,"
were her accustomed line, and well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
indeed she played them. <i>Widow Warren</i>, in
"The Road to Ruin," <i>Mrs. Skewton</i>, in "Dombey
and Son," <i>Betsy Trotwood</i>, in "David Copperfied,"
were kindred felicitous portraitures;
and no one can think of Burton as <i>Sleek</i> and
<i>Toodle</i> without instantly associating Mrs.
Hughes as <i>Lady Creamly</i> and <i>Mrs. Toodle</i>.
How many times did they play those parts together!
In all those lighter pieces and farces
Burton made so popular and famous, she was
his ally and strong support; and no history of
the drama of that period can be written without
conspicuous mention of her name; nor can
the professional career and triumphs of Burton
be recounted without suggestion and remembrance
of Mrs. Hughes. Their professional
relation was perfectly harmonious, and
she was with him to the last. She went with
him from Chambers Street to the New Theatre,
and when that was given up accompanied
him on all his starring tours, acting with him
when he appeared for the last time in New
York, and when he acted for the last time in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
his life at Hamilton, Canada. In a speech
Burton once made, he thus referred to their
theatrical relations: "I have been her father,
her son, her uncle, her first husband, her second
husband, and her third husband, her friend, and
her disconsolate widower, and I have liked her
better and better in each relation!"</p>

<p>Even as far back as 1826 Mrs. Hughes was a
great favorite. H. B. Phelps, in his valuable
work known as "Players of a Century," gives a
notice of the press she received for a benefit
night at that period, which he says is worth
preserving as a model: "Mrs. Hughes takes
her benefit at the theatre to-night. It would
be an insult to the generous enthusiasm of her
numerous admirers, to say another word on the
subject."</p>

<p>As it cannot fail to be of interest to readers
of this volume, we copy from Mr. Phelps's book
a reply to a letter addressed by him to the
Hon. Charles Hughes, State Senator, asking
information respecting Mrs. Hughes's subsequent
history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;Mrs. Esther Hughes, formerly Mrs.
Young, was my mother. She died upon her farm,
three miles from this village (Sandy Hill, N. Y.),
on the 15th of April, 1867, at the age of seventy-five,
from the effects of an accident (falling down
stairs, caused by vertigo). She had left the stage
before the war, her last engagement being a travelling
tour with W. E. Burton, in the South and
North. She was acting in Albany as Mrs. Young
when the war of 1812 was declared, and I have
often heard her speak of Solomon Southwick and
of John O. Cole, who was a boy in Southwick's
office. Her many years of theatrical life speak for
themselves."</p>

<p>We have heretofore alluded to the Miss
Agnes Robertson of long ago; and now a memory
steals in upon us of her débût at Burton's,
and of her enchanting performance in the protean
play of "The Young Actress." Of the
half dozen parts assumed, the Scotch lassie and
the Irish lad still haunt us. The highland fling
of the one and the "Widow Machree" of the
other were charming to see and hear; and, indeed,
Miss Robertson was charming altogether.</p>

<p>We could give a long list of actors and actresses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
who from year to year were enrolled in
the Chambers Street company, and whose efforts
are pleasantly remembered. We do not
mean to slight them; but we must hasten
toward our appointed goal. One actress, however,
a recognized favorite in New York long
before her engagement with Burton, which terminated
with her farewell to the stage, deserves
more than a passing notice, for the pleasure
she gave was as pure and healthful as it was
winsome and bright. We refer to Miss Mary
Taylor&mdash;"Our Mary,"&mdash;better known and esteemed
than any actress of her day, except
Charlotte Cushman, that we can recall.</p>

<p>We shall not dwell upon any part of her
career, nor examine her dramatic capabilities.
She never appeared without eliciting the warmest
of welcomes; and when we try to think of
the many characters we saw her in, we find ourselves
remembering only how sweet and good
she was. We were present at her farewell
benefit, and during the speech Mr. Burton made
for her the emotion throughout the house, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the thought of parting, was as sincere as it was
deep. She stood, visibly affected, in the midst
of her companions, and when the curtain fell
there was a sigh, as if the audience had lost a
friend.</p>

<p>We have endeavored in the foregoing to indicate
the strength of the Chambers Street
company, and we think the reader cannot fail
to be impressed by the exhibit. The fact of
such dramatic portraiture being easy, seems to
us a striking proof of its supreme excellence.
The majority of them were they living now
might be comedy stars. When we have Jefferson,
Raymond, Fawcett Rowe, Stuart Robson,
and Florence, starring about the country,
playing their one part hundreds of nights,
what shall we think of Burton, Placide, Blake,
Brougham, Lester, Johnston, and the rest, appearing
together nightly in characters of varied
but equal dramatic power? There has been a
great change since then. The name of the
places of amusement now is legion, and one
bright star in the heaven of scenic splendor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
consoles the public for the loss of a concentration
of wit and genius. As we recall for a moment
all that bright array, we are taken back
through the maze of distance, and old familiar
forms arise; we see the glimmer of accustomed
footlights; the scene is alive with well-known
faces; we even hear voices that we know; we
join in the old-time plaudits&mdash;and forget how
many years have rolled between! There is no
retrospection without its tinge of sadness.
"Never to return" is the refrain of human
memory. How beautifully Holmes expresses
it in "The Last Leaf":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The mossy marbles rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the lips that he has pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In their bloom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the names he loved to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have been carved for many a year<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On the tomb."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The years of the Chambers Street Theatre
were fruitful in dramatic events. We have already
mentioned "Dombey and Son," in 1848;
and that signal triumph was followed by
"David Copperfield," "Oliver Twist," "Nicholas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Nickleby," and "The Pickwickians." The
immortal <i>Toodles</i> was first seen October 2,
1848, and an account of that performance will
be found in our Recollections. It became
later the custom of the management to present
"The Serious Family" and "The Toodles"
every Tuesday and Friday in each week, so
great was the popularity of those pieces.
People came from all parts of the country to
see them; parents brought their families and
relatives; and one middle-aged couple, a husband
and wife, never failed, for successive
seasons, to occupy the same seats at every representation.
All the old comedies were given
in due course, with that perfection of cast to
which we have alluded, and those pieces made
famous by Burton's acting&mdash;such as "The
Breach of Promise," "Charles XII.," "Happiest
Day of my Life," "Paul Pry," "Family
Jars," "Soldier's Daughter," "Charles II.,"
"How to Make Home Happy," etc., (and
which now seem for ever lost,)&mdash;were a constant
source of joyous pleasure. The wisdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and good judgment of the manager were conspicuous
in the nightly programmes, and it
may here be said that no theatrical caterer
ever excelled Burton in an acute perception
of what was needful to meet the public taste,
and in providing the requisite entertainment.
To wide experience he added intuitive appreciation
of stage effect, and his extensive knowledge
of the drama was seen in the disciplining
of his forces and in his sagacious distributions.
It must not be forgotten that as manager as
well as actor Burton shone in the prosperity
and fame of his theatre; and it will not be
when now we touch on the Shakespearian revivals
that lent such beauty, grace, and dignity
to his stage, and revealed the manager in the
gracious aspect of a profound and reverent
student of the mighty dramatist. These revivals
were the crowning triumphs of Burton's
management. The production of "A Midsummer
Night's Dream," "Twelfth Night,"
"The Tempest," "Winter's Tale," "The
Merry Wives of Windsor," marked an era in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
theatrical representation, for up to that time
no attempt had been made so ambitious; and
the success that attended the enterprise was in
all respects richly deserved. "A Midsummer
Night's Dream," in particular, won universal admiration.
The fairy portion was so beautiful;
the play before the duke so capital; that Shakespeare's
creation acted upon the public like a
revelation, and heart and mind felt the glow of
a new sensation. The notices of the press were
so unqualified in their praise of "A Midsummer
Night's Dream," that they were
gathered and issued in a pamphlet as a tribute
to the achievement. The effect of the succeeding
revivals was similar in kind, and the
people marvelled at the resources of a management
that on so limited a stage could produce
such wonderful results. And with these plays
of Shakespeare came the impersonations of
<i>Nick Bottom</i>, <i>Sir Toby Belch</i>, <i>Caliban</i>, <i>Autolycus</i>,
and <i>Falstaff</i>&mdash;never to be forgotten by
those who witnessed them, and of which a
more extended review is given in our Recollections.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
It only needed Shakespeare to round
the glory of Chambers Street; after that there
were no more worlds to conquer.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Mr. Burton as Timothy Toodle.</span></div>

<p>Following the years, we find a record of "As
You Like It," produced for the benefit of the
American Dramatic Fund at the Astor Place
Opera-House, January 8, 1850, in which Burton
appeared as <i>Touchstone</i>, with a cast including
Hamblin, Bland, Jordan, Chippendale, Chapman,
Miss Cushman, Mrs. Abbott, Mrs. Walcott,
and Mrs. J. Gilbert. In the same year he
played a short engagement at the Chatham
Theatre, and also essayed to revive the old
Olympic; but the division of attraction was of
brief duration. His home was in Chambers
Street, and there, to borrow from Lord Tennyson,
the banner of Burton blew. The usual even
tenor of the theatre was varied by new accessions
to the company, and by first appearances,
and other interesting events. The present
Miss Maggie Mitchell appeared June 2, 1851,
as <i>Julia</i>, in "The Soldier's Daughter"; but we
cannot say positively that the occasion was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
her stage débût. May 3, 1852, was the farewell
benefit of Mary Taylor, to which reference has
already been made. September 6th of the
same year was the date of the "Centenary
Festival of the Introduction of the Drama into
America," at Castle Garden, and we find Burton
figuring in the elaborate and attractive programme
as <i>Launcelot Gobbo</i>, in "The Merchant
of Venice." Miss Agnes Robertson made her
New York débût October 22, 1853, and November
23d of the same year witnessed the
production of "The Fox Hunt," an original
comedy by Dion Boucicault, in which Burton
appeared as <i>William Link</i>. In 1854, that long
baronet, Sir William Don, entered upon the
scene, and in the same year (December 18th) a
benefit to Morris Barnett occurred, on which
occasion "The Serious Family" was given
with all the honors. Mr. H. A. Perry made
his débût in 1856, playing <i>Gossamer</i>, in "Laugh
When You Can," and that actor was also seen
as <i>Leontes</i>, in "Winter's Tale."</p>

<p>Every summer for several years, during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
recess at Chambers Street, Burton played engagements
at Niblo's with a selection from his
company, and was seen at that resort in a round
of his favorite characters. This was a great
boon to strangers visiting the city, and to those
whose circumstances kept them in town. It
was some consolation to be moved to mirth,
and there never was any disaffection in Burton's
summer constituency. But the theatrical tide
was setting uptown, and the rapid growth of
the city counselled a removal to more available
neighborhoods; and so, following the current,
the manager bid farewell to the scene of so
many triumphs, and leased the building originally
known as Tripler Hall, calling it the
Metropolitan, or, as stated by Ireland, "Burton's
New Theatre," where he opened September
8, 1856, with "The Rivals."</p>

<p>The Chambers Street Theatre was opened
July 10, 1848, and was closed September 6,
1856. The eight years of its existence are
replete with fascinating dramatic history, and
are a copious and important contribution to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the annals of the stage. It was the school of
many an actor who rose to fame, and the most
famous actors of the time were seen upon its
boards. It was the birthplace of plays and
characters never excelled in their effect upon
an audience, and its record is graced by a noble
and poetic celebration of Shakespeare's immortal
works. And who shall say how many
hearts were lightened, and spirits cheered, by
the good genius of mirth that presided there?</p>


<p class="center">1856-1860</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the New Theatre,
to those who had been accustomed to the cosiness
of Chambers Street, was not <i>Burton's</i>.
The home feeling so peculiar to the other
house could not readily be reproduced in the
spacious auditorium of the Metropolitan. The
far-reaching stage seemed alien and unreal, and
the lofty walls were cold and unfamiliar. There
were changes in the company, too; old favorites
were missing, and a kindred interest was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
not awakened by new-comers. But the manager
was there, and with wonted energy began
the campaign. The first season was prosperous,
and many of the well-known Chambers Street
pieces were revived and given with effect.
Daniel Setchell made his appearance September
25, 1856, and grew rapidly in public favor.
This comedian at a later date essayed the part
of <i>Aminadab Sleek</i>; but, as Ireland observes,
"Burton's <i>Sleek</i> alone filled the public mind,"
and the effort was not encouraged. The Irish
comedian, John Collins, was seen about this
time, and in November Dion Boucicault and
wife opened an engagement. January 13,
1857, Burton played <i>Dogberry</i> for the first time
in New York, and the same year (May 14th)
Edwin Booth appeared at the New Theatre
as <i>Richard III</i>. It was in this year (October)
that Burton was seen in Albany for the first
time, playing a round of his famous parts; and
it is interesting to note that the present Joe
Jefferson, then at Laura Keene's, "during the
absence of Burton," to quote Ireland again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
"was recognized as the best low comedian
in town." Burton also appeared in Boston for
the first time in 1857, opening in <i>Captain
Cuttle</i>. His reception was so extraordinary in
warmth and enthusiasm that he lost control of
himself and could not speak for several minutes.
This engagement was at the Boston
Theatre, and every night the house was
crammed. He visited Boston again in 1858,
and with the same gratifying success.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that these starring tours
suggested to Burton a new and prosperous field
of activity, and perhaps some physical symptom
dictated relief from the strain and responsibility
of management. From whatever cause,
after another season of varying fortune, the
Metropolitan was given up (1858), and he commenced
a starring tour with the highest success,
"his name and fame," says Ireland,
"being familiar in every quarter of the Union,
and more surely attractive than any other
theatrical magnet that could be presented."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-9.jpg"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><img src="./images/1-9thumb.jpg" alt="" title="Mechanics' Hall Poster."></img></span></a></div>

<p>In conjunction with Mrs. Hughes and a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
members of his former company, he opened an
engagement at Niblo's, July 4, 1859, playing to
crowded houses. His last appearance in New
York was at the same theatre, on the occasion
of his benefit, October 15, 1859, playing <i>Toodle</i>
in the afternoon, and <i>Mr. Sudden</i>, <i>Toby Tramp</i>,
and <i>Micawber</i> in the evening, supported by
Mrs. Hughes as <i>Mrs. Toodle</i>, <i>Mrs. Trapper</i>,
and <i>Betsy Trotwood</i>. "On the day and evening
of his benefit," says Ireland, "more than
six hundred persons who had paid for tickets
received their money back from the box-office,
not being able to obtain admission."</p>

<p>On Saturday, December 3, 1859, Mr. Burton
started for Hamilton, Canada, to fulfil an
engagement there and at Toronto. A terrible
snow-storm was met on the way; the train was
blocked; and the delay and discomfort consequent
were almost unendurable. While recovering
from the exposure and fatigue, Mr.
Burton wrote the following letter to his children,
and we are kindly permitted to make use
of it in this volume. It will be read with interest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
not only for its feeling, but for its graphic
vigor of narration and humorous spirit. And
we believe it was the last letter he ever
wrote.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hamilton, Canada;</span><br />
<i>Sunday, December</i> 4, 1859.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Darling Children</span>:</p>

<p>Here I am, in this provincial city of the Western
wilderness, snowed up, 500 miles away from
my dear home and my precious treasures. Such
a day and night as we had yesterday I hope
never to go through again. You remember how
warm it was on Friday? positively hot; and on
the next morning the weather was cold as New
Year's, but clear and brisk, and the icy tone of the
atmosphere seemed to agree with me. We reached
Albany in good order, and started at twelve on the
long trip to the Suspension Bridge, over 300 miles,
with a light fall of snow, blown about in every direction
by a very low sort of a high wind. As
we got on our way we found the snow getting
deeper, and the flats of the Mohawk River covered
with ice. We dined at Utica&mdash;a pretty fair
meal, with cold plates and Dutch waiters, who
looked cold too. When we changed cars at Rochester
the wind blew ferociously, and the snow fell
heavily, so much so that some fears were expressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
that a drift might form on some part of the road
and prevent our progress for a while. At the Suspension
Bridge, at half-past twelve in the night, I
had to get out of the car and wade ankle deep in
snow to the open road beside the baggage-car, and
pick out and give checks for our wagon-load of
trunks, seeing them safely deposited in another car
for transportation into Canada. I thought this was
a hard job, but it was nothing to what I had to do
in Canada, and really a pleasant little episode compared
with my doings hereafter. We crossed the
Suspension Bridge within sight of the Falls of
Niagara, but we saw them not. The wind howled
as we passed over that fearful gulf, and drowned
the roaring of the Falls and the rumbling of the
rapids as they boiled along some 170 feet below us.
I confess that I rejoiced in reaching <i>terra firma</i>,
even on the cold, inhospitable land of Canada.
Well, we thought we were snugly housed for the
balance of our journey, some forty-four miles to
Hamilton, where we intended to rest for the night
(at two in the morning) and pass a cheerful Canadian
Sunday in our own rooms looking at the snow,
when we were roused from our seats: "Change
cars and re-check your baggage." Out we turned,
bundles, bags, shawls, top-coat, brandy bottle,
cough mixture, papers, books, and growls, leaving
behind my old travelling cap, which I have had for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
years, and is now gone for ever. When I got out I
had to jump into a bed of snow up to my knees,
wade a quarter of a mile through the unbroken
whiteness to a stand of cars inhumanly situated far
from the shelter of the dépôt or the lee of any
building whatever. There, in that snow, without
any feeling in my feet, the wild wind whistling no
end of Verdi overtures with ophicleide accompaniment
in the snort of various engines, I had to select
my nine packages, see them weighed, have them
checked, wait while the numbers of the checks were
written down, copied off for me, and a receipt written
for the payment imposed on me for extra baggage.
If I had not been so miserably perished
with cold, I could have felt some pity for the poor
officials who had to do all this, not only for me, but
for some twenty others, and in the open air too.
But it seemed that I had all the baggage in the car.
"Who owns 57,467?" "I do." "Why, you have
baggage enough for a dozen." And it was so. The
nine boxes looked like ninety in the confused atmosphere
of steam and drifting snow. "That's
all right, sir." "Then why don't you put the
trunks in the baggage car?" "So we will when
they have passed the customs"!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Yes, my darlings, at that hour, past midnight, in
the open snow-storm, with a wind that killed old
<i>Cuttle's</i> "What blew each indiwiddiwal hair from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
off yer 'ed," in a blinding drift of frozen crystals
biting each feature and driving their minute but
piercing angles into every pore, I had to wait the
presence and the pleasure of Victoria's excisemen,
to say whether my baggage might or might not pass
duty free into her infernal dominions. I had one
cheerful and pleasant thought that filled my bosom
with religious delight while I waited. I remembered
playing <i>Harrop</i> in the drama of "The Innkeeper's
Daughter,"&mdash;he is an old smuggler, and <i>shoots the
exciseman</i>. I remembered that when I fired the
pistol and the victim dropped, I exclaimed "He's
done for!" and the audience laughed and applauded!
Yes, the discriminating public applauded me for
killing that exciseman! Oh, was it to do again!
How well I could kill that Canadian gauger here, in
the snow-storm, at midnight, on the banks of the
mad Niagara! Don't be alarmed, darlings. I
didn't kill him. He came at last, booted up to
his middle, with a Canadian capote and hood, and
a leather belt buckled tightly around his waist.
But, despite his Canadian costume, the Cockney
stuck out boldly all over him. He had a roast-beef-and-porter
look, red cheeks, and big English
whiskers. Again I had to go over my list, "great
box, little box, bandbox, bundle," to the potentate
of the tariff. I gave him my honor as a gentleman,
etc., and then told him my profession, and, oh! my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
loves&mdash;oh! my darling children&mdash;what is fame? <i>he
had never heard of Mr. Burton, the comedian!</i> Of
course, after that, you agree with me that he ought
to be killed at once, "without remorse or dread."
And he had such an aggravating smell of hot steak
and brandy-and-water. Now, I suppose you think
that my <i>Ledger</i> story of intense interest, describing
the agonies of a middle-aged (or more so) individual,
is over. Not a bit of it. The fifth act is to come.
We were jogging along in the cars, slowly crunching
the hard snow on the rails, when we came
gradually to a full stop. Presently whisperings
were heard, occasional and inquisitive male passengers
braved even the fury of the storm, and went
abroad to see what was the matter, and in a few
minutes we learned that there was a "break in the
road." You will ask the meaning of the phrase&mdash;so
did I, without avail. Gradually the passengers
withdrew from the car (we had but one) and I was
compelled to look for myself. There had been a
collision, or rather an overtaking, for a fast passenger
train ran into a freight train, and fearful work
they made of it. I went back for Mrs. Hughes and
the bags, coats, and books. Heaven knows how we
got along, in such a fearful storm, knee-deep in
snow and the track full of holes, with a yawning
gulf on each side. When at last we reached our
place of refuge, we found the car so high off the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
rail that it seemed impossible to mount it. Some
gentlemen helped Mrs. Hughes in, with such exertions
that I expected to see my dear old friend
pulled into bits. Then your poor father was left to
his fate. I got up&mdash;don't ask me how, but when I get
home I'll climb into my bedroom window from the
street, to show you how I did it. We had with us
in the car an admiring friend from Detroit, who
claimed relationship with me because his son married
Niblo's niece. Well, we mustered in the car,
wet, weary, excited, and chilled to the centre. Oh!
my precious ones, didn't that brandy bottle come
in well in that scene? How I let them smell it, and
only smell it! How I took a drink and smacked
my lips, and drank again, and didn't I win the
heart of old Niblo's brother's daughter's husband's
father by giving him a big drink? At last we
started, slowly, backed into Hamilton at half-past
four in the morning, with snow two feet deep in the
streets. Half an hour's ride in a dilapidated article
of the omnibus genus, and we were dumped at a
place a cad called the "Hanglo-American 'Otel,"
recommended me by Miss Niblo's marital ancestor.
A fire in my room, a quiet night's rest, a good
breakfast (first-class venison steak), and I feel quite
well. My feet were wet. My boots could hardly
be pulled off, and in revenge to-day they won't be
pulled on. Now am I not a brave old papa to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
carry a heart disease and a nervous cough through
such scenes?</p>

<p>We are now forty miles from Toronto, whither
we proceed at nine in the morning. I hear melancholy
doings are prevalent at the place we are
bound to, and this deep snow will not make it any
better. If business is bad, I shall stay but one
week, and go to Rochester for the second week.</p>

<p>I am afraid our plants at Glen Cove were badly
hurt by the cold spell coming on so suddenly. I
hope this weather has not increased your coughs.
My cough is still troublesome, but I am every way
better.</p>

<p>May the great God of goodness keep His blessing
on all my children; may they keep in health,
and in the spirit of love with each other, is the
nightly prayer of</p>


<p class="center">Their affectionate father,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">W. E. Burton</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The last appearance of the comedian on any
stage was at Mechanics' Hall, Hamilton, Canada,
December 16, 1859. He played <i>Aminadab
Sleek</i> and <i>Goodluck</i> in "John Jones." He returned
from the trip in an almost exhausted
condition, and, after lingering for nearly two
months, suffering greatly, died of enlargement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of the heart, February 10, 1860. Mr. Burton
left a wife and three daughters, all of whom
are living. His remains were interred in
Greenwood Cemetery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is a list of parts acted by Mr.
Burton, and though probably there are many
omissions, it fully justifies Ireland's observation
that his repertory was extended almost indefinitely,
and "carried into a range, where, if he
was sometimes excelled by Placide and Blake,
his rivalry was such as to demand every effort
on their part to retain their generally acknowledged
superiority." It may be mentioned that
the parts of <i>Aminadab Sleek</i> and <i>Timothy
Toodle</i> were acted by Burton respectively six
hundred and six hundred and forty times.

<small>OF</small><br />
MR. BURTON'S PERFORMANCES</h2>

<h2>RECOLLECTIONS.</h2>


<p>When Burton opened in Chambers Street,
he was forty-four years old, in the prime of
life, his powers mature and approaching culmination.
Let us endeavor to give a portrait of
the comedian as he appeared at this time.
Above the medium height; rotund in form,
yet not cumbersome; limbs well proportioned;
deep-chested, with harmonious breadth of
shoulder; neck short and robust; large and
well-balanced head; the hair worn short behind,
longer in front, and brushed smartly
toward the temples; face clean-shaven; complexion
bordering on the florid; full chin and
cheeks; eyes seemingly blue or gray, beneath
brows not over heavy, and capable of every
conceivable expression; nose straight, and
somewhat sharply inclined; mouth large, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
lips thin, and wearing in repose a smile half
playful, half trenchant. Such is the picture
memory draws, the likeness in some degree
confirmed by engravings in our possession.
Outlined thus, and in his proper person, he
seemed in general aspect to blend the suave
respectability of a bank president with the
easy-going air of an English country squire.
We shall have occasion to refer in due course
to the marvellous changes that were possible
to that face and form, when the man became
the actor and walked the stage with Momus,
with Dickens, and with Shakespeare. Prominent
among his physical attributes was a clear,
strong voice, capable of a great variety of intonations,
and his delivery was such that no
words of his were ever lost in any part of the
house.</p>

<p>Before entering the wide field of our memories,
we wish to offer some observations respecting
the comedian's mental equipment,
and to consider briefly the features of his unrivalled
powers. We have no doubt but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the classical education of his youth had much
to do with his early preference for the tragic
muse. His mind, imbued with admiration for
classic form and color, was fed with divine
images, which, while replete with grace and
beauty, bore still the impress of Greek austerity.
He inclined naturally, therefore, toward the
conception of that which was the predominating
influence in his mental training. At the
same time, after eschewing his predilections
for tragedy, he found that the classic discipline
had created a receptivity of mind in the highest
degree important to his future study; and
that quickened apprehension proved of inestimable
value in his subsequent introduction to
Shakespeare, the old dramatists, and in all his
intellectual excursions.</p>

<p>Yielding to him, then, this vantage-ground
of culture, let us glance at the attributes of his
genius, which entitle him, as we think, to the
claim made for him&mdash;namely, one of the greatest
actors in his line the stage has known. We
need not specify that line further than to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
that it passes with the title of "low comedy";
but Burton's versatility was so extraordinary,
his repertory so extended, his conceptions so
forcible, that the theatric nomenclature seems
insufficient to define and measure the scope
and range of his abilities. His impersonations,
especially those Shakespearian, were often of
too high an order to be classed under the accepted
notion of low comedy. Let us style
him an expounder and representative of the
Humor of the Drama in all its aspects,
and we shall come nearer to what he really
was. For an all-embracing perception of
humor revealed itself perpetually in his acting.
As the imagination of Longfellow transformed
to organ pipes the musketry of the Springfield
Arsenal, so would Burton change dull inanities
into vital and joyous images. This informing
power, this native faculty of rising superior to
the part assumed, and investing it with undreamed-of
humorous interest, was an instinct
of his genius, and gave to all his embodiments
an originality and a flavor peculiarly his own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
The character mattered not. It might be
<i>Nick Bottom</i> or <i>Paul Pry</i>, <i>Cuttle</i> or <i>Micawber</i>,
<i>Doctor Ollapod</i> or <i>Charles Goldfinch</i>, <i>Sleek</i> or
<i>Toodle</i>. There was the complete identification,
the superlative realization of the author's
meaning; but the felicitous interpretation, the
by-play, the way of saying a thing, the facial
expression&mdash;his own and no other man's,&mdash;the
Burtonian touch and treatment. In the extravagance
of farcical abandon no one ever was
funny as he. In comic portraits like <i>Toby
Tramp</i> or <i>Jem Baggs</i>, he absolutely exhaled
mirth; and we cannot help thinking how perfectly
Hazlitt describes him in writing of Liston:
"His farce is not caricature; his drollery
oozes out of his features, and trickles down his
face; his voice is a pitch-pipe for laughter."
"We have seen Burton," says Wemyss, "keep
an audience in roars of inextinguishable laughter,
for minutes in succession, while an expression
of ludicrous bewilderment, of blank
confusion, or pompous inflation, settled upon
his countenance." And this was penned by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Wemyss at a time when <i>Cuttle</i>, <i>Micawber</i>,
<i>Sleek</i>, and <i>Toodle</i> were yet to be.</p>

<p>In thus indicating Burton's natural gifts, we
must not lose sight of the study and knowledge
necessary to their development and to
the achievement of his fame. Let it not be
supposed that his famous delineations were so
many intuitions, easily shaped and clothed by
him into substantial dramatic form. Easy, indeed,
they might appear in the handling&mdash;for
it was characteristic of the great comedian
never to seem to entirely expend himself,&mdash;he
always suggested a reserved force;&mdash;but this
facile rendering was attained at the expense of
as much intellectual attrition as Moore declared
the melodious numbers of his verse
often cost him.</p>

<p>The late Dr. John W. Francis relates a conversation
with the famous George Frederick
Cooke, respecting the actor's impersonation of
<i>Sir Pertinax Macsycophant</i>, and in reply to the
question, how he acquired so profound a
knowledge of the Scotch accentuation, Cooke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 154]</a></span>
said: "I studied more than two and a half
years in my own room, with repeated intercourse
with Scotch society, in order to master
the Scottish dialect, before I ventured to appear
on the boards in Edinburgh, as <i>Sir Pertinax</i>,
and when I did, Sawney took me for a native.
It was the hardest task I ever undertook."
How do we know how many years of thoughtful
application the comedian's masterpieces
expressed?</p>

<p>Mr. Burton was a student and man of the
world as well as actor, and the supremacy of
his performances was due to his close and comprehensive
study of his author, his acquaintance
with dramatic composition, his artistic
sense, his thorough knowledge of the stage,
his varied experience, his human insight,&mdash;the
rest, like Dogberry's reading and writing,
came by nature.</p>

<p>It is a habit with old play-goers, when over
their cakes and ale, to recall the "palmy days"
of the drama, and to say: "Ah, you should
have seen&mdash;&mdash;; he was a great artist&mdash;none
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
equal to him nowadays. Ah, the stage has
declined since the old time." We do not
wholly believe in the drama's decadence, but
as we enter upon our Recollections we feel
that <i>there</i> were our palmy days, and the
years seem long between. Twenty-four have
passed since the comedian died, and there has
been no sign of a successor to the mask and
mantle. And it may be twice&mdash;nay, thrice
twenty before the actor shall arise who will
compel us to recall the triumphs of Burton
for the sake of comparison.</p>

<p class="center">
MR. BURTON IN FARCE.</p>

<p>A man like Mr. Burton, endowed with keen
humorous perception and the mimetic faculty,
competent to express easily and with unction
every phase of mirthful extravagance suggested
by fancy and flow of spirit, must occasionally
yield to the imperious demands of
his nature, and, perforce, when so pressed, he
opens the safety-valve of play and gives escape
to his excess of humor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>In this connection, we are reminded of Sydney
Smith, as an example of humorous irrepressibility.
Restraint seldom fettered the
expression of the witty suggestions of his
fancy. It was as natural in him to be gay
and mirthful as it was to breathe. His humor
welled from a perpetual spring. It was like
the profanity of the Scotchman who didn't
swear at any thing particular, but just stood in
the middle of the road and "swore at large."
There is a story that the divine, arriving first
at a gathering of notables, was ushered into
the drawing-room, which was hung with mirrors
on all sides. Seeing himself reflected at all
points, he looked around and observed: "Ah,
a very respectable collection of clergymen!"
Now his only auditor was the servant; but the
thought came and was at once expressed. Of
course, Sydney Smith could be serious when
he wished, as all know who are familiar with
his life and works; but he had his play-ground
at Holland House and in kindred coteries, where
his buoyant spirit worked its own sweet will.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
When the clergyman of lugubrious aspect
called upon poor Tom Hood, the story goes
that the humorist could not help remarking:
"My dear Sir, I'm afraid your religion doesn't
agree with you!"&mdash;and we are quite willing to
believe the story to be one of "Hood's Own,"
for it has all the flavor of the author who gave
us "Laughter from Year to Year." Instances
might be multiplied of this humorous self-abandonment;
but we are growing digressive.
The train of reflection, however, leads us to
the belief that Burton's merry-making powers
needed occasionally an avenue of escape; and
the safety-valve, in his case, was often found in
the farces his acting made so popular&mdash;those
exhibitions of fun and drollery in which,
through the lens of memory, we now intend
to view him.</p>

<p>The farce, by the way, is a thing of the
past. It may almost be said that as a form of
the acting drama, at least in America, it has
been passed to the limbo of disuse. Rarely, if
ever, do our programmes nowadays bear the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
old, familiar formula: "To conclude with the
laughable Farce of&mdash;&mdash;." We are no longer invited
to laugh at the droll situations and funny
dialogues contained in the many pieces of
Buckstone, Mathews, and Morton; yet all will
admit their efficacy to beguile a lagging hour,
and to smooth away the obtrusive wrinkle
from the proverbial brow of care. Such, certainly,
was the power they exerted in other
days; and perhaps it is to be lamented that the
frolic atmosphere diffused by those comic productions
is ours no more to make merry and
revel in. "Custom exacts, and who denies
her sway?" remarks Colman, the younger;
and for many years the design of our managers,
in catering for the public, has comprehended
the representation of one play only for
the performance of an evening; setting it
elaborately, bestowing upon it a wealth of
scenic embellishment, and presenting it generally
with a due regard to strength and fitness
of cast. Many of the standard comedies
have been thus illustrated&mdash;notably "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
School for Scandal" and "She Stoops to Conquer";
the comedies of Robertson&mdash;"Home,"
"Caste," "School," "Ours,"&mdash;have been so
rendered at Wallack's, and at the same theatre
that play of charming improbabilities, "Rosedale,"
has enjoyed a periodic return. "Led
Astray," acted so long at the Union Square
Theatre; Mr. Daly's many successful adaptations,
and the Irish dramas of Mr. Boucicault;
"The Two Orphans"; "The Banker's Daughter";
"Hazel Kirke";&mdash;all these, and more,
are like examples. Mr. Jefferson's "Rip Van
Winkle" suffices for an evening; so also does
Mr. Raymond's <i>Col. Sellers</i>, and so also did Mr.
Sothern's <i>Dundreary</i>. This new departure
may be a very good departure, for it gives
us perfection in the details of scenery and
costume, and concentrates the managerial
resources in one splendid whole; and we may
add, that a theatrical system is to be commended
when it permits the audience to get
comfortably home and to bed before midnight.
But, all the same, if Burton were living and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
acting, the farce would hold its own; and
every auditor would remain to the fall of the
curtain, for the last glimpse of that face, the
last word and action of that comedian who held
such sway over the risibilities of mankind.</p>

<p>If among our readers there should be any
old play-goers, they cannot fail to remember
how often they dropped in for an hour's hilarity
with "The Wandering Minstrel," or "Poor
Pillicoddy." For, as previously stated, it was
a circumstance by no means unusual to see
fresh arrivals lining the walls of the theatre,
drawn thither by the potent magnet of Burton
in the farce. It was a matter of almost as
much consequence to know what afterpiece
was on the bill as what comedy. Often, indeed,
the effect produced by Burton in some
exceptionally droll part had become so widely
known, that to see him in it was the prime
object of a visit to the theatre; and if to
the question&mdash;"What does Burton play
to-night?" the answer named <i>Toby Tramp</i>,
<i>Madame Vanderpants</i>, or the like, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
enough: "Let us go!" was the eager exclamation.</p>

<p>What a piece of fun was <i>Toby Tramp</i>, in
"The Mummy"! How many who are living
now will laugh as they recall the appearance of
Burton in that close-fitting garment, covered
with hieroglyphics! The plot is simple and
easily told. <i>Toby</i> is an itinerant player, needy
and shabby, out at elbow and out of money;
and agrees for a cash consideration to personate
a mummy, already sold and promised to an old
antiquarian. As we think of the scene in
which the bargain is concluded we remember
how full of stage strut and quotation Burton
was, and how he embraced the opportunity to
present a specimen of <i>Toby's</i> histrionic quality,
selecting the familiar soliloquy of <i>Richard</i>, and
giving it as he (<i>Toby</i>) declared Shakespeare
ought always to be interpreted. He commenced:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now is the winter of our discontent"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and with the words turned up his coat-collar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
blew his fingers, shivered, and was frozen generally.
Continuing then:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Made glorious summer by this sun of York"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he instantly thawed, threw open his coat,
puffed, and from his brow wiped the perspiration.
And so he went through the whole. At
the words "Grim-visag'd war," a gloomy and
malignant frown darkened his features, which
changed, as he pronounced "hath smooth'd
his wrinkled front," to a bland expression of
peace;&mdash;and the climax was reached when at
the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the lascivious pleasing of a lute"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he executed a fantastic dance, thrumming the
while an imaginary guitar.</p>

<p>This burlesque, for aught we know, may
have been an interpolation, a contribution of
Burton himself to the fund of merriment&mdash;one
of the instances, in fact, where he dropped the
rein and let Momus have his way. But however
it came, the travesty created unbounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
amusement, and put the audience in the best
possible humor; yet we feel how pointless is
our sketch to even suggest the facial power, the
comic attitudes, the air, the touches of drollery,
born of the whole scene; and our readers must
summon their imagination to help our failure.</p>

<p>The next scene is the antiquarian's museum,
and the mummy is brought in. After the
necessary raptures consequent upon such a
unique possession, the professor withdraws and
the stage is left alone. There lies the mummy
in his case, and a pause succeeds. The intent
audience observe a slight movement in the
box. Slowly the head of Burton is raised, and
he glances warily around the room. Raising
himself to a sitting posture in the case, he
turns toward the audience his marvellous face,
on which rests an expression of doleful humiliation.
We shall never forget how, finally, he
rose to his feet, stepped out of the case, walked
abjectly to the foot-lights, looked his disguise
all over with intense concern, and then turned
to the house&mdash;by this time scarcely able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
contain itself&mdash;and said, with the accent of
self-reproach and mortification&mdash;"I'm&mdash;&mdash; if
I'm not ashamed of myself!"</p>

<p>Situations follow, affording full opportunity
for the display of Burton's humorous characteristics;
but we need not pursue them in
detail. He frightens everybody as a mummy;
makes love as a mummy; devours the antiquarian's
dinner; has his tragic bursts;&mdash;- in
short, leaves nothing to be desired on the part
of those who paid their money to laugh and be
jolly with him.</p>

<p><i>Mad. Vanderpants</i> was another uproarious
creation, more laughable even, in some ways,
than "The Mummy." <i>Joe Baggs</i> (Burton) is
a lawyer's clerk, and during the absence of his
employer on a journey, arranges a programme
of deviltry for himself and comrade (T. B.
Johnston). <i>Baggs</i> becomes <i>Mad. Vanderpants</i>,
and his companion <i>Miss Smithers</i>, her assistant,
and they advertise for "A Thousand Milliners."
Burton's "make-up" was one of the
most astonishing things we ever saw, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Johnston's was by no means lacking in artistic
finish. The milliners arrive (that is a representation),
and then ensues an hour of unparalleled
fun and frolic. The manner of Burton in
sustaining the character and in replying with
complacent air to the numerous questions
asked by the deluded damsels, was so supremely
ludicrous that we pause in writing to laugh
at the remembrance. Some work is wanted,
and the window shades are unceremoniously
torn down and given to the milliners. "What
shall we do with it?" ask they. "Do?" replied
Burton, with imperturbable gravity, "Why,
you can hemstitch it up one side, and back-stitch
it down the other&mdash;and then gusset it all
around!" The fun waxes fast and furious,
when suddenly the employer returns. The
<i>dénouement</i> can be imagined; we cannot describe
it;&mdash;but those who remember Burton's
mimetic power, and his faculty to express
abject terror and kindred emotions, can well
understand what a scene of indescribable riotous
humor it was. And we cannot omit, in referring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to this farce, to mention the admirable
support given by the lamented Mrs. Hughes,
who, as one of the milliners, contributed largely
to the general success by her conscientious
acting.</p>

<p>How can we, in this allotted space, deal
justly with our crowding memories? What
shall we say of <i>Jem Baggs</i>, in "The Wandering
Minstrel"?&mdash;that minstrel whose entrance
on the stage was heralded by a sounding strain
certainly never before heard on sea or land,
and whose appearance, as he emerged from the
wing, continuing still the dirge-like air, was a
signal for a gleeful burst all over the house.
How paint his introduction, under a mistaken
identity, into musical society; the situation
that follows; his song of "All Around My
Hat"; the comic incidents that strew the
too-fleeting hour of his career?</p>

<p>How view him as <i>Pillicoddy</i>, awaiting with
supreme anguish the "turning up" of his wife's
"first," through all the phases of ludicrous
bravado and comic despair?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>How depict him in "Turning the Tables"?
or in "The Siamese Twins"? or in "That
Blessed Baby"? How see him as <i>Mr. Dabchick</i>,
in "The Happiest Day of My Life"? or as
<i>Megrim</i>, in "Blue Devils," and ever so many
more?</p>

<p>And yet we ought to linger on each one; for
we have never seen them since, and it may be
we may never see them again&mdash;certain is it
that we shall never see them so performed.
And only for the sake of refreshing a memory
of something greater would we wish to behold
them now.</p>

<p>In concluding this imperfect tracing of
recollection, we are conscious of many deficiencies;
one of these a few final words may
supply.</p>

<p>We have said nothing of the individualization
of Burton's many characters in farce. It
is true that the native hue and flavor of the
comedian's humor were so strong, and his
physique so pronounced, that he himself was
always more or less apparent in whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
guise; but it would be a great mistake to suppose
that in the parts above named there was
no essential difference, with respect to portraiture.
There was a difference, and it was
clearly marked. Each was a picture by itself&mdash;each
a distinct characterization; and in the
development the author was often left so far
behind that the actor became the creator.
But this loyalty to ideal perception denotes,
as it seem to us, that even in farcical abandon
his delineations were shaped and governed by
his artistic sense.</p>


<p class="center">MR. BURTON IN PARTS HE MADE SPECIALLY
FAMOUS.</p>

<p>The familiar picture of John Philip Kemble
in the character of <i>Hamlet</i>, standing at <i>Ophelia's</i>
grave, in sad retrospection over the skull of
Yorick, always impressed us as a revelation of
the fact that an actor's fame is bequeathed to
posterity in the traditions of effect produced
by a few celebrated embodiments, and is forever
associated with those special triumphs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
That Kemble was a supreme representative of
the impressive school, that he merited the
glowing eulogium contained in Campbell's eloquent
verses, there will be no question; but
when we think of him or read of him, the
figure of the Dane looms up in sombre majesty,
and we are haunted by the avenging
spirit of Elsinore.</p>

<p>The picture of Edmund Kean, as <i>Richard</i>,
kneeling at the feet of <i>Lady Anne</i>, with the
words, "Take up the sword again, or take up
me," upon his lips, impresses us in the same
way; and any thought of that great tragedian
conjures an attendant vision of the dark and
aspiring <i>Gloster</i>.</p>

<p>When, in the years to come, the name of
Jefferson is spoken, will not imagination linger
on <i>Rip Van Winkle's</i> long slumber amid the
everlasting hills? and will not Sothern and
Raymond appeal to a future generation as
<i>Dundreary</i> of the glaring eye, and <i>Sellers</i> of
the uplifted arm? And we have no doubt
that Mr. Burton is, in the memory of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
now living who saw him, and will be to those
who shall know him from tradition and dramatic
annals, the actor who was so inimitable
as <i>Captain Cuttle</i>, <i>Aminadab Sleek</i>, and <i>Timothy
Toodles</i>. And no wonder. The mere mention
of them opens the flood-gate of recollection,
and we seem to hear far down the aisles of
time the free, glad laughter of delighted audiences.
If, haply, in our memories hitherto we
have struck in some heart the chord of reminiscence,
surely now we may hope to prolong
the strain. For, among the many who are still
here to tell of their nights at Burton's, few,
perchance, will revert to <i>Bob Acres</i> or <i>Goldfinch</i>,
<i>Nick Bottom</i> or <i>Autolycus</i>; while all, at
the comedian's name, will at once summon the
images of <i>Cuttle</i>, <i>Sleek</i>, and <i>Toodles</i>.</p>

<p>In view of the extraordinary popularity of
these performances, we shall treat now of
certain parts made specially famous by Mr.
Burton, and present in another group a view of
other and various characters in his comedy
repertory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>A favorite part, and one which always delighted
us, was that prince of stage busybodies,
<i>Paul Pry</i>. The character as Poole drew it affords
unusual scope for the exhibition of comic
power, and in Burton's hands its humorous
possibilities were made the most of. The play
was frequently on the bills, and always drew a
house that followed the comedian through all
his mirth-moving entanglements in a state of
hilarious enjoyment. The more we think of it,
the more we are disposed to class <i>Paul Pry</i> as
one of Burton's masterpieces, so rich was it in
certain phases of humor and so replete with
droll suggestiveness. It may not, perhaps, be
generally known that Mr. Burton was the second
comedian who played the part in England,
and it was a favorite of the renowned Liston,
whose impersonation of it won him fame
and fortune. There is a story to the effect
that at the last rehearsal of the comedy, previous
to its presentation at the Haymarket,
Liston was undecided as to his costume; and
while on the stage, still doubtful and uncertain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
a workman entered on some errand, wearing a
large pair of Cossack trousers, which, it being a
wet day, he had tucked into his wellingtons.
The appearance of the trousers struck Liston,
who adopted the idea; and hence the origin of
the dress peculiar to <i>Pry</i>. We remember very
well the general effect of Burton's "make-up";
can recall various details; but the point of the
trousers is not clear; so a better memory than
ours must determine whether or no Liston's
notion was perpetuated by his successor.</p>

<p>We see Burton now, as he entered upon the
scene at <i>Doubledot's</i> inn with: "Ha! how
d' ye do, Doubledot?" and we hear him asking
with ingratiating audacity question after question,
pausing for an answer after each one, and
in no wise put out at getting none,&mdash;"never
miss any thing for the want of asking, you
know." Then his lingering departure, and
<i>Doubledot's</i> fervent: "I've got rid of him
at last, thank heaven!" No, he returns. "I
dropped one of my gloves" (looking about).
<i>Doubledot</i> waxes impatient and speaks his mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
"Mr. Doubledot," said Burton, swelling with
insulted dignity, "I want my property; I want
my property, sir. When I came in here I had
two gloves, and now&mdash;ah&mdash;that's very odd;
I've got it in my hand all this time!" (hasty
exit). How little it seems in the telling. The
air of anxiety on returning, and the eye-glass
brought into play; the look of injured innocence,
the indignant assertion, and then the
sudden collapse&mdash;cannot be reproduced in
words.</p>

<p>The piece is full of diverting situations, but
nothing was more natural than that Burton
should improve on and add to them. His
bright instinct kindled the dry fagots of a
scene till they fairly crackled with merriment.
Certain "business," humorous amplification
of dialogue, a diffusion of comic incident, that
we vividly recall, are not to be found in the
printed "Paul Pry"; and the conclusion of
the second act, especially, where the pistols
are used with such ludicrous effect, all that
was Burton's own. The pistols lay on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
table, left there by <i>Col. Hardy</i>, and <i>Pry</i> is
alone. Burton took them up, one in each
hand. He regarded the weapons fixedly.
Then, with solemn enunciation: "I never
fought a duel; but if I was called out," extending
an arm, "I say if I was called out"&mdash;bang!
went one of the pistols, and down
dropped Burton, the picture of fright, when
bang! went the other, and the curtain fell on
the comedian sitting in abject terror, a smoking
pistol in each hand, gazing in every direction
for succor, and wildly ejaculating "Murder!"
Then, at the close of the play, when <i>Pry</i> reminds
<i>Col. Hardy</i> that, thanks to him (<i>Pry</i>),
things, after all, have resulted to the satisfaction
of everybody, the <i>Colonel</i> relaxes his
sternness somewhat and says: "Well, I will
tolerate you; you shall dine with me to-day."
"Colonel," replied Burton, with airy condescension,
"I'll dine with you every day."</p>

<p>It was a rare pleasure to see Placide and
Burton in their respective parts; and as once
again we think of them the Chambers Street
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
stage is before us, and the garden scene; and
we see <i>Col. Hardy</i> place the ladder against the
wall, mount it and peer cautiously over, and
then hastily descend, saying: "I have him;
there he is, crouching on the ground with his
eye at the key-hole"; see him quietly approach
the gate, suddenly open it, and once again as of
old, Burton tumbles in, umbrella and all, with
"How are you, Colonel! I've just dropped in!"</p>

<p>He will never more drop in for us, nor does
it seem likely that in our day another <i>Paul Pry</i>
will appear. The play may have been performed
in New York since the comedian's
death, and we seem dimly to remember that it
was; but we have no recollection beyond the
simple circumstance. We feel sure, however,
that public interest in it ceased with the departure
of its last great representative; and
equally sure that in the memory of those who
saw it, Burton's <i>Paul Pry</i> remains a famous
creation of delightful humor.</p>

<p>What shall we say of <i>Captain Cuttle</i>? How
many readers and lovers of Dickens thronged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the theatre in the old days to witness that
wonderful reproduction? and how many to
whom Dickens was but a name were led by the
impersonation to study the pages of the great
novelist? It is certain that Burton by his
sympathetic and admirable portrayal awakened
a fresh interest in the enchanting story, so
potent to excite intellectual pursuit is fine and
sagacious interpretation. "Dombey and Son"
was one of the great triumphs of the Chambers
Street Theatre, and not to have seen it constituted
an offence against public sentiment
utterly without palliation. That it was Charles
Dickens dramatized by John Brougham was
enough of itself to claim respectful attention;
and when Burton added the crowning effect of
his acting of <i>Cuttle</i>, then indeed was the
dramatic feast complete. Nothing could be
clearer than that the comedian had made careful
and conscientious study of his author, and
nothing surer than that the portrait was conceived
in an appreciative and loving spirit. If
those familiar with the character as depicted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
by Dickens discerned at times certain felicitous
touches in Burton's delineation which suggested
an originality of method and treatment,
the points were due, we think, to the genius of
the novelist acting upon the actor's imagination,
and kindling it to the expression of cognate
verisimilitude.</p>

<p>What a memory it is to linger on! How
the form comes back, clad in the white suit;
the high collar, like a small sail, and the black
silk handkerchief with flaring ends loosely
encircling it; the head bald at top, a shining
pathway between the bristling hair on each
side; the bushy eyebrows arching the reverential
eyes; the knob-environed nose; the waist-coat
with buttons innumerable; the glazed
hat under his left arm; the hook gravely
extended at the end of his right. "May we
never want a friend in need, or a bottle to give
him! Overhaul the Proverbs of Solomon, and
when found make a note of," we hear him
saying; and then we follow him through those
inimitable scenes which cannot be easily forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
by those who witnessed them. The
scene where he cheers up <i>Florence</i>, and makes
such dexterous play with his hook, adjusting
her bonnet and manipulating the tea&mdash;and yet
exhibiting a simple and natural pathos with it
all; where he sits in admiring contemplation
of <i>Bunsby</i>, while that oracular tar delivers his
celebrated opinion respecting the fate of the
vessel, with the memorable addendum: "The
bearings of this observation lays in the application
on it"; the scene with the <i>MacStingers</i>,
and the <i>Captain's</i> despair; the timely intervention
of <i>Bunsby</i>; the despair changed to
wondering awe; and then all the suggestive
by-play consequent upon his delivery by
<i>Bunsby</i> from the impending <i>MacStinger</i> vengeance;&mdash;all
this, and much more than we can
describe, passes by like a panorama in memory.
Burton's <i>Captain Cuttle</i> occupies a conspicuous
place in the gallery of famous dramatic pictures,
and there it will long remain.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> As we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
think of it in all the details which made it so
perfect an embodiment, it seems a pity that
Dickens himself never saw it. We can fancy
that had he chanced to be in New York when
"Dombey and Son" was the theatrical sensation,
and had dropped in at Chambers Street,
an auditor all unknown, he would have made
his way behind the scenes, and to Burton's
dressing-room, and with both hands would
have grasped the comedian's hook and enthusiastically
shaken it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Mr. Burton as Aminadab Sleek.</span></div>

<p>"The Serious Family" and "The Toodles"!
What memories of joyous, laughing hours the
names awaken! Never, we venture to say,
were playhouse audiences regaled with so
surpassing a feast of mirth as that spread by
Burton in his performance of those renowned
specialities&mdash;<i>Aminadab Sleek</i> and <i>Timothy Toodles</i>.
No comedian, we believe, of whom we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
have any record, excelled those efforts in
variety of mimetic effect, facial expression,
and display of comic power. That in them
the extreme limit of humorous demonstration
was reached, the public generally acknowledged.
The two plays had their regular
nights, and thousands flocked, week after
week, to the banquet of jollity, all unsatisfied,
though again and again they had revelled
there. No greater contrast could be offered
an audience than that presented by the two
pieces of acting. The sanctimonious and
lugubrious <i>Sleek</i>; the effusive and rubicund
<i>Toodles</i>! Coming one after the other, in every
way so different, the instance of versatility
made a deep impression, and prompted a
thought on the flexibility of human genius.
We are reminded at this moment of an incident
which occurred one evening in connection
with "The Serious Family," which added an
unexpected feature to the entertainment.
Burton did not appear in the first piece, and
the audience, eager for <i>Aminadab</i>, were glad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
when the orchestra ceased. But the prompter's
bell did not tinkle. After a pause the orchestra
played again, and again finished. Still no
bell. Signs of impatience began, and as the
delay continued the hubbub increased. An
attempt on the part of the musicians to fill
the gap was received with evident displeasure.
At last, when nearly half an hour had elapsed,
the bell sounded, and the curtain rose on the
familiar group of <i>Sleek</i>, <i>Lady Creamly</i>, and
<i>Mrs. Torrens</i>. Applause broke out all over
the house; but with it were mingled a few
ill-humored hisses. Burton left his place at
the table and came forward to the foot-lights.
There he stood in the well-known suit of
pepper and salt, the straight gray hair framing
the solemn visage of <i>Sleek</i>. Then, in his own
proper voice, he explained the cause of the
delay&mdash;a mishap of travel,&mdash;expressed his
regret, and begged the indulgence of the
audience. A storm of approval followed his
speech, in the midst of which he resumed his
place, instantly assuming his character; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
as the applause died away another voice succeeded,
the voice of <i>Sleek</i>, in nasal tone, saying:
"We appeal to the disciples of true
benevolence, and the doers of good deeds,
without distinction of politics or party," etc.
The effect of the transition was irresistible;
and the loss of time was forgotten in the gain
of a new delight. And now another story of
"The Serious Family" comes to mind, and it
is too good to be lost. Playing in Atlanta,
Georgia, he found a wretched theatre, without
appointments or properties. At the conclusion
of the overture the prompter ran to
Burton with the announcement that there
was no bell to ring up the curtain. "Good
gracious, what a place! Here, my lad," he
said to a little fellow who acted as call-boy,
"run out and get us a bell&mdash;any thing will do&mdash;a
cow bell, if you can't get any thing better."
Away went the boy, the orchestra vainly endeavoring
to quiet the audience with popular
airs. Back came the boy, pale and breathless,
gasping out: "There ain't a bell in the whole
town, sir!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's to be done now?" asked the
prompter.</p>

<p>"Shake the thunder!" No sooner said than
done. Up went the curtain, and "The Serious
Family" commenced amidst the most terrific
peal heard in that theatre for many a year.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that Burton's <i>Sleek</i>
and <i>Toodles</i>, especially the latter, though
founded on another's outlines, were so built
upon and humorously amplified, that in diverting
dramatic effect they were clearly his own
creations, and owed their importance to the
impress of the actor's transforming power.
When we read "The Serious Family" as written
by Morris Barnett, clever though it be, we
see at once where the author ends and the
actor begins; and as for "The Toodles," it is
sufficient to say that the <i>Timothy Toodles</i> of
Burton was never dreamed of by the playwright.</p>

<p>How shall we describe to those who were
born too late to witness them, these famous
performances of the great comedian? We feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
that all description must fail in giving any idea
of the infinite variety and scope of comic
humor they exhibited. We might, indeed, for
they are vivid in remembrance, take our readers
through the many scenes, and show them
<i>Sleek</i>, from the entrance of <i>Captain Maguire</i>, in
the first act, to Burton's enraged exit in the
last; picturing, as we go, the situations without
parallel in droll device and mirth-moving complication;
show them <i>Toodles</i>, from his arraignment
of <i>Mrs. Toodles</i> for her multifarious and
preposterous bargains, not forgetting the <i>door-plate</i>
of <i>Thompson</i>&mdash;<i>Thompson</i> with a <i>p</i>&mdash;nor
"he had a brother,"&mdash;to his inimitable tipsy
scene and the memorable soliloquy, "That
man reminds me";&mdash;but, however exhaustive
the relation in words, after all was said, we
should still hopelessly leave the effect to be
guessed at with the help of imagination.</p>

<p>We have thus endeavored to give impressions
from memory of certain parts in which
Burton was specially famous; and they seem
to us, on account of their versatility and range
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of humorous spirit, to be conspicuous examples
of that varied power which led us to
style the comedian an expounder of the Humor
of the Drama in all its aspects. If the sojourn
on earth of old Robert Burton was intended to
give the world an "Anatomy of Melancholy,"
surely the mission of the later Burton was to
lay bare the whole body of mirth.</p>


<p class="center">MR. BURTON IN COMEDY AND SHAKESPEARE.</p>

<p>As we think of the many parts in which it
was our good fortune to see Mr. Burton, we
are led into a reflection on the surprising versatility
displayed by them; and we question
whether the record of any comedian embraces
a repertory so extensive, so varied, and so distinguished
for general ability. The performances
we are about to recall, though exhibiting
many humorous features in common, were each
a distinct conception; and the execution of
each was a dramatic portrait by itself, artistic
in measure, faithful in delineation, and felicitous
in the expression of points of character.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
The Burtonian element&mdash;in the shape of by-play,
gesture, accent, facial device, mimetic
effect&mdash;was visible in the composition, as a
matter of course, contributing to the picture's
expansion, deepening its tints and emphasizing
its characteristics,&mdash;added touches that were
the actor's stamp and sign-manual. We have
cited <i>Sleek</i> and <i>Toodles</i> as strongly contrasting
parts, and so indeed they were; but we might
easily adduce instances of versatility quite as
striking, and would do so were it not more
than likely that they will appear to our readers
as our memories progress. It is said that the
celebrated William Farren used to style himself
a "cock salmon," the only fish of his kind
in the market; and if unique dramatic distinction
lies in that piscatorial image, most assuredly
Mr. Burton was a cock salmon of the
first water.</p>

<p>We cannot hope to remember every thing
we saw Mr. Burton play, yet we think our
recollection will embrace a fair array of those
characters in comedy and divers pieces which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
he alone in his generation seemed adequately
to fill, and which were such a boon of delight
to the audiences of long ago.</p>

<p>There was his <i>Micawber</i>, in the dramatization
of "David Copperfield," which succeeded
"Dombey and Son,"&mdash;equal to if not surpassing
his <i>Cuttle</i>; an inimitable reproduction
of the novelist's creation, full of humorous
point, and sustained with an indescribable airy
complacence and bland assumption of resource,
that made it a perfect treat to lovers of Dickens;
and those who saw "David Copperfield"
may well rejoice, for they hold in memory
Burton's <i>Micawber</i>, Johnston's <i>Uriah Heep</i>,
and Mrs. Hughes' <i>Betsy Trotwood</i>!</p>

<p>There was <i>Bumble</i>, the beadle, in "Oliver
Twist," a very funny piece of acting, and
especially so in the well-known scene with <i>Mrs.
Corney</i>, where, in excess of tenderness, he tells
her that "any cat, or kitten, that could live
with you ma'am, and <i>not</i> be fond of its home,
must be a ass ma'am." And then when the
matron is called away and the beadle remains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
his proceedings are described by Dickens thus:
"Mr. Bumble's conduct on being left to himself
was rather inexplicable. He opened the
closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the
sugar-tongs, closely inspected the silver milk-pot
to ascertain that it was of the genuine
metal, and, having satisfied his curiosity on
these points, put on his cocked hat cornerwise,
and danced with much gravity four distinct
times round the table. Having gone through
this very extraordinary performance, he took
off the cocked hat again, and spreading himself
before the fire with his back toward it,
seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an
exact inventory of the furniture." We deem
it enough to say that Mr. Burton's management
of the foregoing "business" left nothing to be
desired.</p>

<p>We may note, in the mention of "Oliver
Twist," that <i>Nancy Sykes</i> was played by the
late Fanny Wallack, with a fidelity of purpose
and a pathetic abandon that made it painful to
witness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>To continue with Dickens: there were
<i>Squeers</i> and <i>Sam Weller</i>, both capital in their
way&mdash;the last, however, lacking, as it seemed
to us, in true Wellerian flavor; but the <i>Squeers</i>
was marked by an appreciative recognition of
the schoolmaster's grim traits; and the scene at
<i>Dotheboys Hall</i> was admirably given; Mrs.
Hughes, as <i>Mrs. Squeers</i>, "made up" to the
life, and irresistible in her distribution of the
treacle.</p>

<p>All these portraits from the pages of Dickens
were so many meritorious presentments of the
novelist's creations, and would have won enduring
fame for an actor of smaller calibre; the
truth is, in Mr, Burton's case, that his <i>Bumble</i>,
<i>Squeers</i>, and <i>Weller</i> were but dimly seen, owing
to the greater glory of his <i>Cuttle</i> and <i>Micawber</i>.</p>

<p>We saw Mr. Burton as <i>Bob Acres</i>, in "The
Rivals"; as <i>Tony Lumpkin</i>, in "She Stoops to
Conquer"; as <i>Goldfinch</i>, in "The Road to
Ruin"; as <i>Doctor Ollapod</i>, in "The Poor
Gentleman"; as <i>Sir George Thunder</i>, in "Wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Oats"; as <i>Job Thornberry</i>, in "John Bull"; as
<i>Sir Oliver Surface</i>, in "The School for Scandal";
as <i>Graves</i>, in Bulwer's "Money"; as
the <i>Mock Duke</i>, in "The Honeymoon"; as
<i>Adam Brock</i>, in "Charles XII."; as <i>Van
Dunder</i>, in "The Dutch Governor"; as <i>John
Smith</i>, in "Nature's Nobleman"; as <i>Mr. Sudden</i>,
in "The Breach of Promise"; as <i>Thomas
Trot</i>, in "Paris and London"; as <i>Don Ferolo
Whiskerandos</i>, in "The Critic" of Sheridan;
as <i>Triplet</i>, in "Masks and Faces";&mdash;certainly a
gallery of dramatic portraits that would put
to the test the highest order of ability; and
we feel bound to say that Burton passed the
ordeal well deserving the encomiums that were
bestowed upon his efforts. It would be too
much to expect that all these delineations were
even in points of conception and execution;
yet all were entitled to respectful consideration,
and many were masterpieces. We will
endeavor to go through them briefly, in remembrance
of the happy hours we owe to their joyous
influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The recent appearance of Jefferson as <i>Bob
Acres</i> has aroused a new interest in the character,
and from all accounts the performance
was more than equal to expectation, and has
enhanced the reputation of the comedian. We
hope to have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jefferson
in due time, and we fancy that his acting
of <i>Acres</i> would refresh somewhat our recollection
of Burton in the part. As it is, however,
we cannot vouch for a clear memory of Burton's
<i>Acres</i>. We saw it but once, and then early in
life, when we were new to the theatre; and all
we seem to remember is that he was very
funny with his curl papers, and his "referential
or allegorical swearing," and that the duel
scene was very amusing. It was the opinion of
Hazlitt that Sheridan overdid the part, and
accordingly he goes on to say: "It calls for
a greater effort of animal spirits and a peculiar
aptitude of genius in the actor to go through
with it, to humor the extravagance, and to
seem to take a real and cordial delight in
caricaturing himself." This criticism is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
without force; but whatever may have been
Burton's conception, we are certain that a
bright intelligence informed it, and that in the
portrayal a requisite display of "animal spirits"
was not lacking. If, among the audience that
greeted Jefferson, there chanced to be any old
play-goers of tenacious memory who had seen
Burton, let us hope that they improved the
occasion by pleasant reminiscence.</p>

<p><i>Tony Lumpkin</i> was a very comic piece
of acting, and made the people laugh immoderately;
but we confess that the character
has little charm for us. Burton used to sing
the song of "The Three Jolly Pigeons" (in
the ale-house scene) with more expression than
melody; but he threw into it a great deal of
frolic spirit and made it quite a feature.</p>

<p>In our youthful days, when witnessing "The
Road to Ruin," we knew very well the moment
when we should hear the voice of <i>Goldfinch</i>
outside; and we remember his bustling entrance,
in sporting frock, buff waiscoat, and
top boots, whip in hand, and his rattling flow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of horse-talk; his strut and his "that's your
sort!" It is said that Lewis, of Covent Garden,
(the original <i>Goldfinch</i>,) "gave to that
catch-phrase a variety of intonation which made
it always new and effective"; and Burton certainly
played upon it adroitly. His delivery
of the text was full of point and animation,
and his articulation admirable. "Why, you
are a high fellow, Charles," says <i>Harry Dornton</i>.
"To be sure!" replies <i>Goldfinch</i>, "know
the odds&mdash;hold four-in-hand&mdash;turn a corner in
style&mdash;reins in form&mdash;elbows square&mdash;wrist
pliant&mdash;hayait!&mdash;drive the Coventry stage twice
a week all summer&mdash;pay for an inside place&mdash;mount
the box&mdash;tip the coachy a crown&mdash;beat
the mail&mdash;come in full speed&mdash;rattle down the
gateway&mdash;take care of your heads!&mdash;never
killed but one woman and a child in all my
life&mdash;that's your sort!" We hear Burton's
voice, we see his face and his gestures now!</p>

<p>We were always fond of Colman's "Poor
Gentleman," and we took great delight in
seeing Burton as <i>Doctor Ollapod</i>. As all know,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the character affords wide scope for diverting
treatment. The incidents are many and droll&mdash;and
we think Burton turned every thing to
the best account. Henry Placide played the
part more artistically; but it was not possible
for him to expound its humorous nature with
the richness that came easily to Burton. We
never think of Colman's comedy without a
feeling of grateful pleasure; for its representation
at various times gave us Burton and
Placide as <i>Ollapod</i>; Burton as <i>Sir Robert
Bramble</i>; Dyott, as <i>Worthington</i>; Mrs. Hughes
as <i>Lucretia McTab</i>; and Johnston as <i>Humphrey
Dobbins</i>.</p>

<p>We have referred in another place to <i>Sir
George Thunder</i> and <i>Job Thornberry</i>; and we
need not dwell upon them further than to say
that both gave glimpses of that versatile power
to which we have alluded, and both were full
of the comedian's characteristic ability.</p>

<p>We suppose that <i>Sir Oliver Surface</i> would
not be deemed a part exactly in Mr. Burton's
"line"; and yet, as we remember it, he invested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the character with a simple dignity, and
played it with manly directness and feeling.</p>

<p>Our memory of <i>Mr. Graves</i> and the <i>Mock
Duke</i> is dim and distant; but if our readers
desire another example of versatility, we
commend the two parts as furnishing a most
conspicuous instance.</p>

<p>We have never seen "Charles XII." and
"The Dutch Governor" since we saw Burton
as <i>Adam Brock</i> and <i>Van Dunder</i>; but we
assure the play-goers of to-day that the dramas
were well worth seeing long ago when Liston
played in them, and equally so when his great
successor appeared in them at a later period.
Burton rarely played <i>Adam Brock</i>, and we
cannot remember seeing it more than once,
when it impressed us greatly. "The Dutch
Governor," on the contrary, was a favorite
attraction at the Chambers Street Theatre,
and Burton's <i>Van Dunder</i> was a rich feast of
mirthful enjoyment.</p>

<p>Pardey's "Nature's Nobleman," purporting
to be an American comedy, was first produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
at Burton's in 1851. The prologue, which was
spoken by the manager, contained these lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The drama languishes. Let us detect&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Polonius-like&mdash;the cause of this defect!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis certain that the sprightliest tongue must fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win attention to an 'oft-told tale.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cannot, ever, with 'crook'd Richard' fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or weep with Desdemona every night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even cloying is the luscious sack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we too often sip with 'burly Jack';<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, every week, will people take the trouble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To witness Hecate's cauldron hiss and bubble;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can we, as we have done, hope to draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still on the Rivals or the Heir-at-Law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We've seen shy 'Jack' his father's anger rouse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We've heard Lord Dowlas 'tutored' by his spouse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old English comedy should now give way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It has, like Acres' 'dammes,' had its day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hang up bag wigs&mdash;our study now should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men and the moustachios that we see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us some pictures of the time provide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the pen practically be applied."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whether or no the comedy gave us "the
men and the moustachios that we see," or provided
"some pictures of the time," we shall
not pretend to say;&mdash;one would think so, since
Blake, Burton, Bland, Dyott, Mrs. Hughes,
Mary Taylor, Miss Weston, and Caroline Chapman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
were in the cast,&mdash;but, at all events, it
gave us Burton's <i>John Smith</i>, which was well
worth a journey to see. <i>John Smith</i> is "gentleman"
to the <i>Earl of Leamington</i> (Dyott), who
is making an American tour. The <i>Earl</i> gives
his attendant a two-months' holiday to enjoy
himself; and <i>Smith</i>, having dressed within an
inch of his life, is taken for the <i>Earl</i>, and yields
to the temptation to pass himself off as such.
Out of this complication arise situations ludicrous
in the extreme, through which Burton
moved, the dispenser of mirth without end.
His "make-up," his air, his self-sufficiency, his
ignorance,&mdash;of which he is grotesquely unconscious,&mdash;his
blundering malapropos speeches,
his frequent social collapses and absurd attempts
at recovery, his facial expression at
mental mishap and irresistible by-play consequent,
his constant display of mimetic power,
his voice, look, manner,&mdash;all together made a
picture of varied humor, which kept the house
in hearty laughter from his entrance to the
curtain's fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Sudden</i>, in Buckstone's "Breach of
Promise," was still another of those peculiar
parts upon which Burton lavished his supreme
gift of humor; and we owe to its diverting exposition
many a gladsome hour.</p>

<p>Funny, too, beyond measure, were <i>Thomas
Trot</i> and <i>Don Whiskerandos</i>; we see the first
in the many comic incidents during the voyage
from Paris to London; and we see <i>Don Whiskerandos</i>
"quit this bustling scene" by rolling
himself with marvellous celerity out of sight
in the folds of the stage carpet.</p>

<p>We have reached the end of our string, with
the exception of <i>Triplet</i>, and should love to
linger in description on the blended humor
and pathos of the impersonation. Let it suffice
that not even Mr. Fisher's admirable presentment
can dim the recollection of Burton's
masterly delineation.</p>

<p>And now let us in our remaining space recall
our memories of the Shakespearian parts in
which we saw the great actor.</p>

<p>"A Midsummer-Night's Dream" was produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
at Burton's in 1854, and the manager
played <i>Bottom</i>. We well remember with what
delight the play was received, and what a
marked sensation was created by the scenery
and stage effect. The public wondered how so
much could be presented on so small a stage,
and its accomplishment was a theme of general
admiration. The fairy element was made a
beautiful feature, and the spirit of poetry
brooded over the whole production. The
unanimity of the press in its encomiums on the
revival was remarkable; and no more emphatic
recognition of Burton's appreciation and knowledge
of Shakespeare could be given than was
expressed in that approving accord.</p>

<p>As we think of it now, it seems to us that
Burton's idea of <i>Bottom</i> was the true one, and
we enjoyed the performance immensely. It is
very easy to make the character a sort of buffoon;
but nothing, of course, was further than
that notion from Burton's conception. Mr.
Richard Grant White gives, in his "Shakespeare's
Scholar," an admirable analysis of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
<i>Bottom's</i> characteristics, and at the close
remarks: "As Mr. Burton renders the character,
its traits are brought out with a
delicate and masterly hand; its humor is exquisite."
We remember his acting in the scene
where the artisans meet for the distribution of
parts in the play to be given before the <i>Duke</i>;&mdash;how
striking it was in sustained individuality,
and how finely exemplified was the potential
vanity of Bottom. With what ingrained assurance
he exclaimed: "Let me play the lion too;
I will roar, that it will do any man's heart good
to hear me; I will roar, that I will make the
duke say, <i>Let him roar again, let him roar
again!</i>" He was capital, too, in the scene of
the rehearsal, and in his translation; and the
love scene with <i>Titania</i> aroused lively interest.
What pleased us greatly was the vein of engaging
raillery which ran through his delivery of
the speeches to the fairies, <i>Cobweb</i>, <i>Peas-blossom</i>,
and <i>Mustard-seed</i>. It goes without saying, that
as <i>Pyramus</i> in the tragedy Burton created
unbounded amusement, and discharged the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
arduous part of the ill-starred lover with entire
satisfaction to everybody.</p>

<p><i>Sir Toby Belch</i>, in "Twelfth Night," was one
of Burton's richest performances, and we remember
it with the greatest pleasure. It was
characterized by true Shakespearian spirit, and
was acted with an animation and unctuous
humor quite impossible to describe. The scene
of the carousal wherein <i>Sir Toby</i> and <i>Aguecheek</i>
are discovered; the arrival of the Clown with
his "How, now, my hearts? Did you never
see the picture of we three?" and <i>Belch's</i>
greeting of "Welcome, ass,"&mdash;inaugurated an
episode of extraordinary mirth, in which Burton
moved the absolute monarch of merriment.
The duel scene and the scene in the garden,
when <i>Malvolio</i> reads the letter, were full of the
comedian's diverting power; and we can recall
no single instance of humorous execution
which more perfectly fulfilled all conditions.</p>

<p>Burton played <i>Touchstone</i> and <i>Dogberry</i>, as
has been mentioned; but it was never our
good fortune to see him in either. We saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
him as <i>Caliban</i>, in "The Tempest"; as <i>Autolycus</i>,
in "Winter's Tale"; and as <i>Falstaff</i>, in
"The Merry Wives of Windsor." His <i>Caliban</i>
we have tried to forget rather than remember;
it terrified us and made us dream bad dreams;
but for all that, we know that it was a surprising
impersonation. His <i>Autolycus</i> was a model
of oily roguery, and another instance of that
wondrous versatility of genius with which the
comedian was endowed. Very dim in memory
is Burton's <i>Sir John Falstaff</i>. We remember
the scene in the Garter Inn, and the letters to
the merry wives, and, of course, the <i>dénouement</i>
of the clothes-basket, and the frolic at Herne's
Oak,&mdash;but we cannot go into detail; and we
always thought we should like Burton so much
better in the <i>Falstaff</i> of "Henry IV." The
mention of "Henry IV." reminds us that it
was once produced at the Chambers Street
Theatre, when Hackett played <i>Sir John</i> to
Lester Wallack's <i>Prince Hal</i>; and in order that
nothing might be lacking in honor to Shakespeare,
Burton and Blake played the two <i>Carriers</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in Scene I. of Act II. Fancy those two
comedians with about twenty-five lines only
between them in a play of five acts! But they
must have covered themselves with glory.</p>

<p>We have endeavored in this retrospect to
furnish a view of the comedian in a number of
characters; and we think, however meagre our
account, it still forcibly indicates the scope and
range of Burton's abilities, and exhibits him
in a wide scene of varied and striking dramatic
power. We have depicted him in farce, in
comedy, and in Shakespearian delineations; and
it is not too much to say that generations will
likely pass ere his fellow shall appear. We
have heard and read of attempts being made
by ambitious actors to revive his masterpieces,
and that the efforts were highly commendable.
Perhaps they were&mdash;</p>

<h2>MR. BURTON'S LIBRARY.</h2>

<p class="center">"My library was dukedom large enough."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<h2>MR. BURTON'S LIBRARY.</h2>


<p>Mr. Burton resided at No. 174 Hudson
Street, New York, and owned also a beautiful
country-seat at Glen Cove, Long Island, now
the property of Mr. S. L. M. Barlow. In a
building adjoining his Hudson Street residence,
and connected therewith by a conservatory
gallery, were contained his magnificent library,
treasures of art, and precious relics. Scholars,
actors, and men of art and letters were frequent
visitors there, and the owner took a
laudable pride in displaying his matchless collection.</p>

<p>A very interesting story of the painter Elliot
may be told in this connection. He was often
a visitor, and the striking resemblance between
the artist's head and the accepted bust of
Shakespeare was a matter of common observation.
On one occasion, on being shown by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Burton a choice Shakespearian acquisition, he
became intensely interested, and quietly seated
himself in a study-chair the better to examine
the prize. "Meantime," says our narrator,
"Burton and myself were engaged in other
parts of the house, and at last we came back
to the library. Burton looked through the
door, and placing one hand on his mouth, he
put the other on my chest, and thus held me
back. I shall never forget his singular look at
the moment. There sat Elliot at the table,
dressed in a suit of plain black, his hand supporting
his cheek, and his eyes intent upon the
book. The evening light from the ceiling fell
softly upon his high and delicately formed
forehead; just over him was an exact copy of
the effigy which marks the great dramatist's
grave. The resemblance, or the hallucination,
for the moment was complete, and Burton,
with eyes fairly dilating with admiration and
astonishment, said: 'Shakespeare living again!
Was there ever such a resemblance?'"</p>

<p>It has been thought appropriate to include
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
in this volume a description of the library,
from the pen of James Wynne, M.D., who
in 1860 published an account of his visits to
various private libraries in New York, and Mr.
Burton's was among the number. At the time
of Mr. Burton's death the collection was probably
larger, Dr. Wynne's visit having been
made at a much earlier date than the publication
of his volume. Every lover of Shakespeare,
we think, will thank us for enriching
this book with a description of that matchless
library.</p>


<p class="center">WM. E. BURTON'S LIBRARY.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton's library contains nearly sixteen
thousand volumes. Its proprietor had constructed
for its accommodation and preservation
a three-story fire-proof building, about
thirty-five feet square, which is isolated from
all other buildings, and is connected with his
residence in Hudson Street by a conservatory
gallery. The chief library room occupies the
upper floor of this building, and is about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
twenty-five feet in height. Its ceiling presents
a series of groined rafters, after the old English
style, in the centre of which rises a dome sky-light
of stained glass. The sides of the library
are fitted up with thirty-six oak bookcases of
a Gothic pattern, which entirely surround it,
and are nine feet in height. The space between
the ceiling and the bookcases is filled
with paintings, for the most part of large size,
and said to be of value. Specimens of armor
and busts of distinguished authors decorate
appropriate compartments, and in a prominent
niche at the head of the apartment, stands a
full-length statue of Shakespeare, executed by
Thom, in the same style as the Tam O'Shanter
and Old Mortality groups of this Scotch
sculptor.</p>

<p>The great speciality of the library is its
Shakespeare collection; but although very
extensive and valuable, it by no means engrosses
the entire library, which contains a
large number of valuable works in several departments
of literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The number of lexicons and dictionaries
is large, and among the latter may be found
all the rare old English works so valuable for
reference. Three bookcases are devoted to
serials, which contain many of the standard reviews
and magazines. One case is appropriated
to voyages and travels, in which are found many
valuable ones. In another are upward of one
hundred volumes of table-talk, and numerous
works on the fine arts and bibliography. One
bookcase is devoted to choice works on America,
among which is Sebastian Munster's "Cosmographia
Novum Orbis Regionum," published in
folio at Basle in 1537, which contains full notes of
Columbus, Vespucci, and other early voyagers.
Another department contains a curious catalogue
of authorities relating to <i>Crime and
Punishment</i>; a liberal space is devoted to
<i>Facetiæ</i> another to American Poetry, and
also one to Natural and Moral Philosophy.
The standard works of Fiction, Biography,
Theology, and the Drama are all represented.</p>

<p>There is a fair collection of classical authors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
many of which are of Aldine and Elzevir
editions. Among the rarities in this department
is a folio copy of <i>Plautus</i>, printed at
Venice in 1518, and illustrated with wood-cuts.
The true name of this writer was T. Maccius
Plautus. He was of humble origin, and is
supposed to have once been a slave. He lived
at Rome about one hundred and eighty years
before the beginning of the Christian era, and
wrote a number of plays which obtained great
celebrity in the time of their author, and continued
to be looked upon as models of this
species of composition for many centuries after
his decease. Twenty of his plays are extant,
which are distinguished for the purity of their
style and the exquisite humor of their characters,
although Horace blames him for the
coarseness of his wit. Gellius, who held him
in much esteem, says that he was distinguished
for his poetry upon the stage at the time that
Cato was for his eloquence in the forum. The
first edition of his works was printed at Venice,
in 1472, by Merula. The edition of 1518,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
in this collection, is so rare as not to be mentioned
by Brunet, De Bure, or Michael Mattaire.
There is also a folio edition of Sallust,
published at Venice in 1511, with wood-cuts;
an excellent copy of Statius, published at
Venice in 1498; and a translation from the
Greek of Plutarch into Latin by Guarini, of
Verona, surnamed Veronese, who was the
first of a family celebrated for their literary
attainments, and who is frequently confounded
with Battista Guarini, the author of "Il
Pastor Fido." Guarini Veronese was the grammarian
of his day, and a strong advocate
for the preservation of the Greek language
in its purity. He was an assiduous student,
and spent considerable time at Constantinople
in copying the manuscripts of the best models
in Grecian literature. Accompanied by his
precious freight, he set sail for Italy, but was
shipwrecked, and lost all of his laboriously
acquired treasure, which produced such an
effect upon him as to change his hair from a
dark color to white in a single night. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
world is indebted to him for the first edition
of the "Commentaries" of Servius on Virgil,
and likewise for the recovery of a number of
manuscript poems of Catullus, which he found
mouldering and almost obliterated in a garret.
With the assistance of his father, he applied
himself to the task of deciphering them, and,
with the exception of a few verses, reproduced
them entirely.</p>

<p>The collection is well supplied with editions
of Virgil. In addition to Ogilby's folio, with
Hollar and Fairthorne's plates, is a choice
copy of the illustrated edition in three folio
volumes, and the very rare <i>fac-simile</i> Florentine
edition of 1741 (<i>Ex cod. Mediceo Laurentiano</i>).
This edition is now so scarce that a
copy was recently sold in London for fifty
pounds sterling.</p>

<p>The collection also contains a copy of the
Vatican edition of Terence, in Latin and
Italian, after the text of Heinsius, with
numerous illustrations of ancient masks, etc.,
published at Rome in two folio volumes in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
1767; an excellent copy of the best edition
of Suetonius, with commentaries by Baraldi,
printed in Roman letter at Paris in 1512;
"Titi Livii," published at Nuremberg in
folio, in 1514, in its original wood binding;
Livy's Roman History, published in 1600&mdash;the
first English edition; "Diogenes Laërtius
de Vitis et Dogmatibus Philosophorum," published
at Amsterdam in 1692; a vellum black-letter
copy of Eusebius, of the rare Venetian
edition of 1483; Boëtius, published in 1570;
the two original editions of the eminent
critic, Justus Lipsius; the Antwerp edition of
Seneca, published in 1570; the same work in
folio, in 1613; and Stephen's edition of
Sophocles, published in 1518, which is an
admirable specimen of Greek typography.</p>

<p>Among the Italian poets is a copy of Dante,
in folio, published in 1497, with most remarkable
cuts; and the "Commentaries" of Landino,
the most highly valued of all the old
commentators upon this poet; also an excellent
large-paper copy of Tasso, in the original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
text, with Morghen's exquisite line engravings,
published in 1820, in two folio volumes.</p>

<p>Cervantes appears to have been quite a
favorite with the possessor of this library, who
has the excellent Spanish edition of 1738, with
Van der Gucht's beautiful plates and many
inserted illustrations, in four volumes; the
quarto edition, published at La Hayé, in 1746,
containing thirty-one plates from Coypel's designs;
Smollett's quarto edition of 1755, in two
volumes, with plates by Grignion after designs
by Hayman; a folio edition by Shelton, with
many curious engravings, published in 1652,
besides several modern editions.</p>

<p>In the historical department is a fine edition
of Montfaucon's works in twenty folio volumes,
including the "Monarchie Française";
the original edition of Dugdale's works, including
the "Monasticon" with the old
designs; Boissardus's "Romanæ Urbis Antiquitates,"
in three volumes, folio; and a
large number of the old Chroniclers, in their
earliest and rarest editions. Among these latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
are two copies of the very scarce "Polychronicon,"
by Raulph Higden, the monk of
Chester: the one in black-letter folio, printed
in 1495, by Wynkyn de Worde, is wanting in
the last page; the other, printed in 1527 by
Peter Traveris, and ornamented with wood-cuts,
is in perfect order. Both of these volumes
have marginal notes, probably in the
handwriting of the day.</p>

<p>The collection is particularly rich in copies
of original editions of old English poetry,
among which are the works of Samuel
Daniel, 1602; Sandy's Ovid, published in
1626; Lucan, by Sir Arthur Gorges, published
in 1614, noticed in Colin Clout, and
personified as Alcyon in Spenser's "Daphnaida";
"Arte of Englysh Poesie," with a fine
portrait of Queen Elizabeth, published in
1589; Quarle's works; Harrington's translation
of "Orlando Furioso," folio, published in
1591, with plates in compartments; Sir W.
Davenant's poems, published in quarto in 1651,
with an original poem in the author's handwriting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
never published; copies of the editions
of 1613 and 1648 of George Wither's poems,
and Chapman's "Seven Bookes of the Iliad of
Homer," published in 1598.</p>

<p>This latter writer, who was born in Kent,
in England, in 1559, was one of the coterie
formed by Daniel, Marlowe, Spenser, Shakespeare,
and others, and lived upon terms of
great good-fellowship with England's greatest
bard. He had no mean reputation as
a dramatic writer, and was, besides, highly
respected as a gentleman. His social position
appears to have been an excellent one,
and his urbanity of manner such as to endear
him to all his friends. His intimate association
with Shakespeare seems to establish the
fact that in his own day the great poet
occupied a prominent place in society, and
was as duly appreciated in his own time, as
Johnson and Pope in theirs. A monument
was planned and erected over the remains of
Chapman by his personal friend, Inigo Jones,
on the south side of St. George's in the Fields;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
but in the changes which have disturbed the
repose of those who were consigned to their
last resting-place in that burial-ground, the
monument has been destroyed.</p>

<p>This department possesses the black-letter
folios of Chaucer in 1542 (the first complete
edition), that of 1561, and that of 1598, all of
which are now quite scarce; the folio editions
of Milton of 1692 and 1695, possessing the old
but characteristic engravings, as well as the
quarto edition in two volumes, published at the
expense of the Earl of Bath; Touson's edition
of 1751, with plates; a large-paper copy of
the edition of 1802, which contains Westall's
plates; and Martin's edition of 1826, enriched
by twenty-four original and beautiful engravings;
likewise the first folio edition of Spenser's
"Fairy Queen," published in 1609, and
Fairfax's Tasso, published in 1624.</p>

<p>Besides the works already noticed, are Sylvester's
"Du Bartus"; Warner's "Albion and
England," published in 1586; "all the works of
John Taylor, the water-poet, being sixty and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
three in number," published in folio in 1630.
This is a very rare work, and is said to have
been sold for eighty guineas. A similar work to
this is the "Shype of Fools of the Worlde,"
translated from Brandt, and published in black-letter
folio, with many wood-cuts, in 1509. A
perfect copy of this work is very rare. The
one in the present collection is wanting in the
title-page and two last leaves.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Its price in
the catalogue Anglo-Poetica, is one hundred
guineas. The copy of Taylor, in the collection,
is a fine large one, and handsomely bound.
The real value of these two last volumes, in a
literary point of view, is perhaps not great,
but still from their peculiar associations they
are highly prized by <i>bibliophiles</i>. Southey
says: "There is nothing in John Taylor which
deserves preservation for its intrinsic merit
alone, but in the collection of his pieces which
I have perused there is a great deal to illustrate
the manners of his age. If the water-poet
had been in a higher grade of society, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
bred to some regular profession, he would
probably have been a much less distinguished
person in his generation. No spoon could
have suited his mouth so well as the wooden
one to which he was born. Fortunately he
came into the world at the right time, and
lived at an age when kings and queens
condescended to notice his verses, and
archbishops admitted him to their tables,
and mayors and corporations received him
with civic honors."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>There is a department of curiosities in the
shape of odd or rare books, which is quite
interesting: among the works are the singular
history of M. Ouflé; the "Encyclopædia
of Man," printed in English after the manner
of Hebrew publications, beginning at the
close of the volume and reading to the
left; "Anteros," by Baptista Fulgosius, in
quarto, published in 1496. This work, "Contre
l'Amour," is said to be of extraordinary rarity.
Likewise the "Zodiacke of Life," published in</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>1588; a curious manuscript in not very good
Latin, with illuminated letters, upon the Lord's
Prayer and the Creed, by Hen. Custas, dated
1614; Memorable Accidents and Massacres in
France, in folio, published in 1598; a singular
black-letter Edict of Emperor Charles V., published
in 1521; a very singular Siamese work
on the laws of marriage; Petri Bembi, with a
frontispiece by Hans Holbein, published in
1518; "Libri Exemplorum," by Ric Pafradius,
published in 1481; the original edition of "The
Rogue; or, Life of De Alfarache Guzman,"
folio, published in 1634, translated by James
Mabbe, otherwise known as Don Diego
Puedesur.</p>

<p>There is also a copy of the "Opera Hrosvite
Illustris Virginis," published in Nuremberg in
1501, in folio, bound in old wooden covers
with brass clamps. This work, which contains
some wood-engravings equal to etchings, probably
the work of Durer, is fully described by
Mengerand in his "Esprit des Journaux";
Pisoni's "Historia," with engravings of birds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
animals, and fishes, that would excite the surprise
of the naturalist of the present day;
"Novus Marcellus Doctrina," published at
Venice in 1476, on large paper, with colored
initials; a curious folio, manuscript history
of the "Starre Chamber"; and Lithgow's
"Rare Adventures and Painful Peregrinationes,"
published in 1632, interlined with
the author's manuscript emendations, and evidently
intended for a new edition. This
work is rare&mdash;the copy owned by King Charles
brought £42 at Jadis's sale.</p>

<p>The collection has a large number of old
Bibles, many thousand biblical illustrations, a
large number of other illustrated works, and
many books and prints especially devoted to
the Cromwellian era of English life.</p>

<p>The Shakespeare department contains
many separate editions of the works of the
immortal bard, each of which is distinguished
by some peculiarity. First among these stand
the four folios published in 1623, 1632, 1664,
and 1685, with a number of the original quartos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of separate plays, illustrated copies, some of
which belonged to able scholars, and are
enriched by their manuscript notes.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton sought to possess every work
that alludes to the early editions of Shakespeare,
or which serves in any way to illustrate
the text. Among these are to be
found many of the original tracts, the scarce
romances, the old histories, and the rare ballads,
upon which he founded his wonderful
plays, or which are alluded to in the text. The
collection contains the book alluded to by the
quaint and facetious <i>Touchstone</i>, in "As You
Like It," by which the gallants were said to
quarrel with the various degrees of proof,&mdash;"the
retort courteous, the countercheck quarrelsome,
and the lie direct"; the "Book of Good
Manners," the "Book of Sonnets" mentioned in
the "Merry Wives of Windsor," the "Book of
Compliments," and the "Hundred Merry
Tales"; and Montaigne, translated by Florio,
who is supposed by some to be the Holofernes
in "Love's Labor's Lost"; the edition of Holinshed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
so freely used by Shakespeare in his
historical plays, with the lines quoted by him
underscored with red ink.</p>

<p>Among the collected editions of Shakespeare
is the first quarto, in seven volumes,
edited by Pope, which, besides having the
reputation of being the least reliable of
any edition of Shakespeare's works, is defaced
by an engraving of King James I. of
England, which the publishers sought to palm
upon the public as the likeness of the great
dramatist. It is engraved by Vertue from an
original painting in the Harleian collection,
and does not possess the slightest resemblance
to any of the various portraits of
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The collection contains a large-paper copy of
Hanmer's beautiful quarto edition, published
in 1744, with Gravelot's etchings, which is now
quite rare; also, the reprint of the same work,
made in 1770, and a fine copy of the quarto
edition, known as Heath's, in six volumes, with
proof plates after Stothard; a beautiful and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
undoubtedly unique copy of the Atlas folio
edition in nine volumes, published by Boydell
in 1802, elegantly bound and tooled with great
richness of design. This copy was selected by
Boydell, with great care, for Miss Mary Nicol,
sister of George Nicol, printer to the king, and
a relative of Boydell. It contains proof impressions
of the engravings, and an extra
volume of original etchings. This work was
purchased at the sale of the Stowe library.
The certificates of Nicol and the librarian of
the Duke of Buckingham, testifying to the
value and rarity of this picked specimen of
typography and engraving, are bound in the
first volume of the work. The collection contains
Mr. Boydell's own private portfolio, with
the original etchings, artist's proof, and proof
before letter, of every engraving, with the
portraits, now so difficult to meet with, of the
large elephant folio plates, upward of one
hundred in number.</p>

<p>But the crowning glory is a folio copy of
Shakespeare, illustrated by the collector himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
with a prodigality of labor and expense
that places it far above any similar work ever
attempted. The letter-press of this great work
is a choice specimen from Nicol's types, and
each play occupies a separate portfolio. These
are accompanied by costly engravings of landscapes,
rare portraits, maps, elegantly colored
plates of costumes, and water-color drawings,
executed by some of the best artists of the
day. Some of the plays have over two hundred
folio illustrations, each of which is beautifully
inlaid or mounted, and many of the
engravings are very valuable. Some of the
landscapes, selected from the oldest cosmographies
known, illustrating the various places
mentioned in the pages of Shakespeare, are
exceedingly curious as well as valuable.</p>

<p>In the historical plays, when possible, every
character is portrayed from authoritative
sources, as old tapestries, monumental brasses,
or illuminated works of the age in well-executed
drawings or recognized engravings.
There are in this work a vast number of illustrations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
in addition to a very numerous
collection of water-color drawings. In addition
to the thirty-seven plays, are two volumes
devoted to Shakespeare's life and times, one
volume of portraits, one volume devoted to distinguished
Shakespearians, one to poems, and
two to disputed plays,&mdash;the whole embracing
a series of forty-two folio volumes, and forming,
perhaps, the most remarkable and costly
monument in this shape ever attempted by a
devout worshipper of the Bard of Avon.</p>

<p>The volume devoted to Shakespeare's portraits
was purchased by Mr. Burton at the sale
of a gentleman's library, who had spent many
years in making the collection, and includes
various "effigies" unknown to many laborious
collectors. It contains upward of one hundred
plates, for the most part proofs. The value of
this collection may be estimated by the fact
that a celebrated English collector recently
offered its possessor £60 for this single volume.</p>

<p>In the reading-room, directly beneath the
main library, are a number of portfolios of prints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
illustrative of the plays of Shakespeare, of a
size too large to be included in the illustrated
collection just noticed. There is likewise another
copy of Shakespeare based upon Knight's
pictorial royal octavo, copiously illustrated
by the owner; but although the prints are
numerous, they are neither as costly nor as
rare as those contained in the large folio copy.</p>

<p>Among the curiosities of the Shakespeare collection
are a number of copies of the disputed
plays, printed during his lifetime, with the
name of Shakespeare as their author. It is
remarkable, if these plays were not at least revised
by Shakespeare, that no record of a contradiction
of their authorship should be found.
It is not improbable that many plays written
by others were given to Shakespeare to perform
in his capacity as a theatrical manager, requiring
certain alterations in order to adapt them
to the use of the stage, which were arranged
by his cunning and skilful hand, and that these
plays afterward found their way into print with
just sufficient of his emendations to allow his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
authorship of them, in the carelessness in
which he held his literary fame, to pass uncontradicted
by him.</p>

<p>There is a copy of an old play of the period,
with manuscript annotations, and the name of
Shakespeare written on the title-page. It is
either the veritable signature of the poet or
an admirably imitated forgery. Mr. Burton
inclined to the opinion that the work once
belonged to Shakespeare, and that the signature
is genuine. If so, it is probably the
only scrap of his handwriting on this continent.
This work is not included in the list
given of Ireland's library, the contents of
which were brought into disrepute by the remarkable
literary forgeries of the son, but stands
forth peculiar and unique, and furnishes much
room for curious speculation.</p>

<p>These forgeries form a curious feature in the
Shakespeare history of the last century. They
were executed by William Henry Ireland, the
son of a gentleman of much literary taste, and a
devoted admirer of Shakespeare. Young Ireland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
who was apprenticed to an attorney,
possessed the dangerous faculty of imitating
the handwriting of another person with such
perfection as to deceive the most careful
critic. His occupation led him much among
old records, by which means he acquired a
knowledge of the phraseology used in them,
and the general appearance imparted by age
to the paper and ink, all of which he was
enabled to imitate very closely.</p>

<p>His father's reverence for Shakespeare induced
him to endeavor to palm off upon himself
and friends, probably at first as a good joke,
some originals of the great poet. One of these
was a declaration of his faith in the Protestant
church, which, when shown to Dr. Parr, drew
from this great scholar the observation that, although
there were many fine things in the
church service, here was a man who distanced
them all.</p>

<p>Mr. Boaden, a gentleman of great taste,
states that when he first saw these papers
he looked upon them with the purest delight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and touched them with the greatest respect, as
veritable and indisputable relics. A number of
gentlemen met at Mr. Ireland's house, and after
carefully inspecting the manuscripts, subscribed
a paper vouching their authenticity. Among
these were Dr. Parr, Dr. Valpy, Pye, the Poet-Laureate,
Herbert Croft, and Boswell. It
is said that when Boswell approached to sign
the paper he reverentially fell upon his knees,
thanked God that he had witnessed the discovery,
and, in the language of Simeon,
exclaimed: "<i>Nunc dimittis servum tuum,
Domine, in pace</i>."</p>

<p>It was now too late for young Ireland to
retreat, if he ever intended to have done so,
and the discovery of the imposture remained
for Malone and Chalmers fully to develop.
The disclosure is said to have brought the
elder Mr. Ireland in sorrow to his grave, and
to have bestowed upon the young scapegrace,
who, either thoughtlessly, or with malice aforethought,
had embittered the last years of
the life of a tender parent, the epithet (which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
clung to him ever afterward) of "Shakespeare
Ireland."</p>

<p>The contemporaries of Shakespeare are
quite numerous. In the cases devoted to the
old English drama are the original and best
editions of Chapman, Marston, Heywood,
Dekker, Greene, Rowley, Massinger, Ford,
Jonson, and Field. Besides the original quartos,
the library contains most of the collected
editions of the old dramatists, and in this department
it is quite complete.</p>

<p>Three book-cases are devoted to works pertaining
to the history of the stage, in every
country and language, from the commencement
of the art to the present time, and scarcely
a work relating to the history, progress, or
criticism of the stage can be named which
is not to be found in the collection.</p>

<p>A full-length statue of Shakespeare in freestone,
placed in a niche upon the northern side
of the room, and surrounded by carved tracery
of a Gothic design, has already been noticed.
Upon the eastern side the Stratford bust is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
placed on a bracket of the age of Elizabeth.
The celebrated antiquary, Cottingham, devoted
his personal attention to this work, and no
other copy has been given to the world. This
bust, the bracket upon which it rests, a curious
old drinking-vessel of stone with a metal lid, all
found in the garden of Shakespeare's house at
New Place, a well-carved head of a Nubian
girl, and the key-stone of an entrance arch of
the theatre at Pompeii, were purchased by the
owner of the present collection at the extensive
sale of the personal effects of Mr. Cottingham.</p>

<p>There is also a beautifully carved tea-caddy,
made from the wood of Shakespeare's mulberry-tree,
which formerly belonged to Garrick,
and a small copy of Roubilliac's statue
of Shakespeare, which is the first specimen of
china-ware executed at Chelsea, in England.
This likewise belonged to Garrick. There are
likewise two drinking-cups with silver rims,
said to be made of the wood of a crab-tree under
which Shakespeare slept during his celebrated
frolic, formerly in the possession of Betterton.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> depicting the career of William E. Burton
as Actor, Author, and Manager, we are aware
of the secondary value of his authorship, as
compared with his dramatic achievements.
Nevertheless, his pen was a ready and fertile
one, and produced much that was meritorious,
though belonging to an ephemeral order. His
plays, however, continue in the list of present
theatrical publications. Of his editorship it
may be affirmed that his conduct of "The
Gentleman's Magazine" and "Literary Souvenir"
was marked by taste and discrimination;
and nothing but unqualified praise can be
bestowed upon his superintendence of the
compilation of humorous literature known as
Burton's "Cyclopædia of Wit and Humor." It is
by far the most complete repository of mirthful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
composition ever published in this country&mdash;or
elsewhere, so far as we know,&mdash;and enjoys
the peculiar advantage of being the only one
in which the productions of American humor
have any thing approaching an adequate representation.
The selections throughout are
indicative of great critical sagacity, and a keen
perception and sympathetic appreciation, in
the general arrangement, are everywhere suggested.
As manager he certainly fulfilled all
conditions, as we believe the relation of his
successes in that sphere will sufficiently attest.
But whatever his capacity in the vocations
named, all is dwarfed by his transcendent
powers as a comedian. He is remembered,
and will be remembered, not as the author or
manager, but as the great actor who swayed
mankind with his supreme gift of humor.
Many of the creations of his genius went away
with him in death; and the traditions of his
triumphs will long be distinguished in dramatic
annals. Lastly, we have seen him a Shakespearian
student and the possessor of a library
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
perfectly glorious in its expression of devotion
and homage to the great poet,&mdash;and linked
with that proud association we leave his
memory and his name.</p>

Dr. Doran, in his "Annals of the Stage," referring to Kean
in various parts, says: "Among these, <i>Sir Giles</i> stands pre-eminent
for its perfectness, from the first words, 'Still cloistered
up,' to the last convulsive breath drawn by him in that famous
<i>one</i> scene of the fifth act, in which, through his terrible intensity,
he once made so experienced an actress as Mrs. Glover faint
away,&mdash;not at all out of flattery, but from emotion."</p>

An amusing experience may be related apropos of Mr.
Norton. Not liking a part in which he was cast, he addressed
the following letter to the manager:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Burton</span>, My Dear Sir:&mdash;It was not necessity which
drove me to America. I wished to travel, to see the country,
and, after having satisfied myself as to whether it pleased me,
professionally or otherwise, to arrange either to remain in it or
return to England. I consider myself greatly insulted by
being cast for the part of Scaley in 'Nicholas Nickleby.' To
offer such an indignity to a gentleman who has held a good
position in the Olympic Theatre, London, under the management
of so great an actor as Mr. W. Farren, where he has
played Sir John Melville, Sir Lucius O'Trigger, Sir Arthur
Lascelles, etc., I consider a great insult, and positively request
you to take me out of the objectionable cast, and in future to
keep to the promise you made on engaging</p>

<p>"Yours, <span class="smcap">W. H. Norton</span>."</p>

<p>Shortly he received the following reply:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Norton</span>:&mdash;When I engaged you I thought
you were merely an actor. I find that you are a gentleman on
your travels, and I have to apologize for detaining you. If
you proceed, let me advise you to visit Niagara about this time.
Take a tour through Canada. After that take your way
through the country generally, not forgetting the caves of Kentucky,
and in mid-winter return to Niagara, a splendid sight.
But should you feel inclined to defer your travels, W. E. Burton
will be happy to retain your services until the close of the
season."</p>

<p>"What could I do or say?" said Norton, relating the incident.
"I literally roared with laughter. He had beaten
